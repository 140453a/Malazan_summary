<p><strong>PROLOGUE</strong><br/>Setting: Malaz City</p><p>A 12-year-old noble boy, Ganoes Paran, looks down as below him, in the poorest part of the city, army wizards are brutally “cleaning” the quarter at the orders of Surly, the woman who formed the assassin’s cult The Claw and is apparently placing herself as Empress (and taking the name “Laseen”) now that Emperor Kellanved has gone missing. As Paran watches, he’s joined by Whiskeyjack, a commander of the elite Bridgeburner unit who warns him off from becoming a soldier. Ganoes mentions that he’s heard the First Sword of the Emperor, Dassem Ultor, is dead in Seven Cities after betraying a god. Laseen shows up and after a tense conversation with Whiskeyjack, who questions her legitimacy and orders, tells him he and his “seditious” troops will soon be shipping out.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong><br/>Setting: Itko Kan, a coastal area on the continent of Quon Tali, seven years later</p><p>SCENE 1<br/>An old woman and a fishergirl watch a troop of soldiers ride by, the girl impressed but the woman cursing that she’s lost three husbands and two sons to the Empire’s wars and reminiscing of when Itko Kan was independent. The old woman, who is a seer, suddenly prophesizes that the girl will travel with the army across the water to the continent of Genabackis and that a “shadow will embrace your soul.” She “links” with the girl just before a soldier riding by hits and kills the seer (thinking, it seems, she was assaulting the girl). Two men then appear—Cotillion (The Rope or Shadow’s Assassin) and Ammanas (Shadowthrone) who agree to use her and her father in some plan of vengeance against Laseen. They send seven Hounds of Shadow after the troop, then disappear.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Adjunct Lorn—personal assistant to the Empress and a mage killer—is sent to examine the slaughter on the coast of Itko Kan, where a mysterious force has killed an entire group of soldiers and a nearby village, save for two huts empty of bodies, one belonging to an old woman, the other to a young girl and her father. Lt. Garoes Paran is already there. After Lorn decides the attack was magical and a diversion, she co-opts Paran to be a commissioned officer on her staff. She then orders a search be made for the missing father and daughter and asks for a list of new army recruits that may fit their description.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>The girl from the first scene joins the Malazan Marines under the name “Sorry” and requests to be sent to Genabackis where, according to the recruiter, the campaign is “a mess.”</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Paran investigates the town of Gerrom and finds it completely deserted save for the Imperial Constabulary, which is filled with soldier corpses. Records of recent recruits have been destroyed. Paran is met by Topper, head of the Claw, a mage, and part Tiste Andii. Topper takes Paran by magical warren to Unta, the Empire’s capital, where he briefly meets the Empress (who recalls meeting him seven years earlier) and then the Adjunct before heading home. There, he is met by his younger sister Tavore, who tells him that his parents are gone, his father is ailing, and their youngest sister Felisin is at her studies.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong><br/>Setting: Pale, on the continent of Genabackis, two years later</p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Two mages, Tattersail and Hairlock, have just survived a spectacularly destructive magic battle with Moon’s Spawn, a floating mountain/sky keep that is home to a large population of Tiste Andii and their lord Anomander Rake. Moon’s Spawn had been protecting Pale, but is now retreating, leaving the city open to the depredations of the Malazan army’s allies, the Moranth. Hairlock is missing the lower half of his body, and as Tattersail wonders at his strange cheer, four Bridgeburners show up (Whiskeyjack, Sorry, Quick Ben, and Kalam). Tattersail learns almost all the Bridgeburners were killed during the attack, buried while tunneling under Pale.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Tattersail flashes back to an earlier planning session that reveals tension and suspicion between the Empress and the Bridgeburners under the command of Dujek Onearm. We learn more about the campaign in Genabackis: the Tiste Andii and the mercenary company the Crimson Guard, under the command of Caladan Brood, have fought the Malazan 5th Army to a standstill in the north, while here at Pale, the High Mage Tayschrenn has arrived to lead an attack on Moon’s Spawn and drive it off. As Tattersail recalls the battle, she realizes Hairlock and her lover Calot (another mage) weren’t killed by Rake but someone else; she suspects Tayschrenn. Two other High Mages were killed: Nightchill was torn limb from limb by a Ken’Ryllah demon (her lover Bellurdan collects the remains) and A’Karonys was crushed by ethereal wings of ice. Moon’s Spawn retreats from the battle, moving south.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Back to present time, Tattersail watches as Quick Ben performs a soul-shifting ritual that puts Hairlock’s mind into a wooden puppet, which they give to her. She agrees to be part of their plans if it means vengeance on Tayschrenn.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>The Bridgeburners discuss that the Empress is deliberately killing off all the old guard that served the Emperor.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Tattersail does a reading of the Deck of Dragons while Hairlock observes, and she draws the Knight of Darkness and Oponn, the two-faced Jester of chance. She sees a spinning coin on Oponn’s card, and afterward also hears the sound of a spinning coin.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong><br/>Setting: Genabaris, Pale, on the continent of Genabackis</p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Sailing to Genabackis, Paran is informed by Topper that he is to take command of Whiskeyjack’s squad (where Sorry—his quarry—is) and take them to the city of Darujhistan, the next on the Empire’s list of conquests. Topper also tells Paran that Sorry has “corrupted” the Bridgeburners and possibly Dujek’s entire army. In the port city of Genabaris, Paran finds out he is to be transported to Pale by the Moranth and their flying Quorls.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Tattersail, in Pale, meets Bellurdan, who is mourning Nightchill and says he plans to raise her barrow on the Rhivi Plain. Meanwhile, Whiskeyjack, Kalam and Quick Ben think that Laseen is trying to eliminate the Bridgeburners, speculate again about who Sorry is, wonder if she was involved in the garroting of an officer, and discuss a plan to “turn the game,” involving Hairlock. Tattersail does a Reading of the Deck of Dragons for Tayshrenn, and sends a message to Whiskeyjack.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>In Pale, Paran meets with Toc The Younger, a Claw member, who warns him that both Whiskeyjack and Dujek are hugely popular among the soldiers and hints that the soldiers’ loyalty to the Empress shouldn’t be tested. He also tells him that his Claw Master was assassinated.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Paran meets several of the Bridgeburners, then is killed by Sorry/Cotillion on his way to the barracks. Shadowthrone and Cotillion discuss their ongoing vengeance scheme with Laseen and that something has entered their Shadow warren.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong><br/>Setting: Pale</p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Tattersail meets with Whiskeyjack, Quick Ben, Fiddler, and Kalam to tell them Hairlock is insane. They reveal their suspicions about Sorry being connected to Shadow as well as their theory that Shadowthrone and Cotillion are in fact Emperor Kellanved and Dancer. We learn that Shadow’s throne was originally occupied by a Tiste Edur, but had been empty for millennia until the Emperor and Dancer’s deaths. Fiddler senses something happening, possibly involving Sorry, and the squad takes off.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Paran awakens before Hood’s Gate but before he is claimed by Hood, Oponn (the twins of Chance) interfere to have someone close to Paran take his place in death’s realm in the future. After they leave, Shadowthrone arrives and agrees to let Paran live so he can use him to find out who opposes his plans. Paran wakes in front of the Bridgeburners looking over what they had thought was his corpse; they bring him to the barracks.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Tattersail does a Deck reading, which includes the Mason of High House Death in a prominent position, and predicts a confrontation between the Knight of Darkness and High House Shadow.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Whiskeyjack and Dujek discuss their belief that the Empire is trying to kill the Bridgeburners. Dujek tells Whiskeyjack the Bridgeburners have his permission to “walk” (desert); Whiskeyjack responds that the soldiers will back Dujek.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>The Bridgeburners and Tattersail meet and discuss that Hairlock is being chased by Hounds through the warrens, that Sorry probably tried to kill Paran and is a tool of Shadow, and that some outside force (a god or Ascendant most likely) intervened in opposition to Shadow and plans to use Paran somehow. Tattersail agrees to nurse Paran back to health while the Ninth Squad head to Darujhistan.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Gear, a Hound of Shadow, chases Hairlock out of the warren and tracks him to Tattersail’s room, where it attacks. Hairlock tries to steal Gear’s soul, but Paran wounds the Hound with his sword Chance and it retreats. Paran and Tattersail both hear a spinning coin. End of Book One.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong><br/>Setting: Darujhistan, on the continent of Genabackis</p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Kruppe dreams of walking out of the city and encountering 6 beggars in an inn on a hilltop. The beggars are consecutively presented as either his Gifts, Doubts, Virtues or Hungers, and a seventh figure may be his Humility. They mention the “youth at whose feet the Coin shall fall,” and Kruppe also hears the spinning Coin.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Crokus Younghand, a young thief, breaks into an estate, stealing the jewelry of a beautiful young maiden, Challice d’Arle. Before he leaves, he admires her sleeping form. Nearby, an assassin named Talo Krafar is injured by a crossbow bolt and, trying to ambush his supposed hunter, shoots at Crokus exiting the d’Arle estate, but Crokus avoids the bolt when he bends down to pick up a dropping coin. Moments later, Krafar is murdered on Krul’s Belfry, and two of his killers set off after Crokus, who has a series of lucky coincidences as he manages to escape from them. The killers—apparently assassins with magical abilities—mention that an Ascendant meddled, and that they want no witnesses.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER SIX</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Crone, a Great Raven of Moon’s Spawn flies down to Darujhistan on a mission from Rake to seek out a particular sorcerer.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>A guard with the alias Circle Breaker mans his position at the Despot’s Barbican and watches as two Darujhistan councilmen meet: Turban Orr and an as-yet unnamed one. The guard muses on an upcoming civil war.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>High Alchemist Baruk reads a message from Circle Breaker, informing him of Orr’s meeting (the other councilman was Feder). We learn Circle Breaker is a servant of the Eel, a mysterious, unknown but powerful figure in Darujhistan, that Baruk is a “secret” power in the city and fighting for its defense, and that Circle Breaker and the Eel have been feeding Baruk information for a year. Crone arrives at Baruk’s window to request a meeting with Rake. Orr arrives.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Assassin Rollick Nom spies on Lady Simtal and Councilman Lim at her estates. Nom is there to avenge a friend against Simtal. He overhears Lim tell Simtal that Baruk has power of some sort and mentions a secret “cabal.”</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Orr and Baruk speak (Crone appears as a dog to Orr) and Orr wants Baruk to agree (and convince the city’s mages as well) to a proclamation of neutrality with the Empire. He tells Baruk that an Empire Claw assassinated all the mages of Pale before the attack. Baruk says his information contradicts this, and refuses to support Orr’s proposition of neutrality. Crone hears a spinning coin and senses a tremble of power from somewhere in the city.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Rollick hears the coin as well and suddenly changes his mind, assassinating Councilman Lim instead of Lady Simtal. Later Ocelot, an assassin Clan leader, tells Rollick that Darujhistan’s assassins are being hunted; they suspect Claws. Rollick is to be bait for a trap.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Crone tells Baruk that a convergence of power is starting. Rake arrives with Dragnipur, his impressive sword, to seek alliance. He tells Baruk that the Claws did not kill Pale’s mages: Rake killed the Claws, but that the mages fled. Rake demands their heads. He also says Tayschrenn attacked his own people. Baruk agrees to give up the mages rather than have Rake use Dragnipur on them.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Inside the Phoenix Inn, Crokus, Murillio, and Kruppe play cards. Coll is passed out drunk. Crokus tells of assassins being killed. Rallick arrives and says it’s just rumor. Crokus suspects Rallick and Murillio of conspiring. We learn Crokus apprenticed in thievery with Kruppe, whose “mask of blissful idiocy” has never slipped in the years Crokus has known him.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER SEVEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Kruppe dreams and meets the Elder K’Rul, who tells him to seek out Adjunct Lorn and Tool, the “Awakeners,” and then says he (K’Rul) will lose a battle.</p><p>SCENW 2<br/>Circle Breaker waits to deliver a plea for help against Turban Orr to an agent of the Eel, but then tears up the message.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Lady Simtal accuses Orr of appeasing the Empire w/ “neutrality” to gain the title of Fist. She fears the traditional Malazan culling of the nobility. She asks Orr set up the murder of coll, her ex-husband.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Murillio manipulates two invitations from Lady Orr to Lady Simtal’s party on Gedderone’s Eve.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Rallick warns Crokus off of thieving the Orr estate. Crokus asks Kruppe (his fence) for his D’Arle stolen goods back and shows Kruppe the coin of Oponn. Rallick and Murillio meet, deduce Crokus is infatuated with Challice D’Arle, and decide to conspire in turning Crokus “honest.”</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Baruk is bothered by noisy roadworkers outside his estate. Kruppe arrives and the two discuss assassins being killed by some outside force and then Kruppe shows Barkuk a wax copy of Oponn’s coin and tells him Crokus is its owner. Baruk tells Kruppe to protect the coinbearer but also to prepare Rallick for the possibility of killing him if necessary.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER EIGHT</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Whiskeyjack and the others have been deposited and armed w/ munitions by the Moranth, who seem to approve of the Bridgeburners, though they recognize the corruption within the Empire. Whiskeyjack tells the squad they’re dropping the Empress’ plan for conquering the city of Darujhistan since it appeared intended to get the Bridgeburners killed, and that they will be following his own plan instead.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Quick Ben meets Hairlock within the warren. Hairlock, who is growing more independent, more powerful, and less sane from his use of Chaos, tells him of the Hound’s attack, Tattersail’s injury, and that Paran’s strange ability to wound the Hound implies the meddling of god(s).</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Quick Ben proposes something, which leaves both Whiskeyjack and Kalam “shaken.”</p><p><strong>CHAPTER NINE</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Toc the Younger is three days out from Pale on the Rhivi Plain looking for Adjunct Lorn. He comes across a group of Malazan Marine elites killed by a group of Barghast (a clans-based people from far away who fought with the Crimson Guard against the Empire). He finds the corpse of the Barghast shaman who had led them (Lorn has a reputation for being tough on magic-users which turns out to be thanks to her sword made of Otataral, a substance that “kills” magic save for “Elder” magic) and then follows the tracks away.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Lorn and the two remaining marines make their stand on an ancient barrow. The marines are killed but Lorn is rescued by the T’lan Imass Tool and Toc, whose father she knew before he disappeared after the Emperor’s death). As they leave, Tool tells Lorn the barrow “yielded a truth.”</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Tattersail awakes and she and Paran discuss what happened: that a god intervened to bring him back, that Whiskeyjack needs to know his assassin, that the coin has stopped spinning, that Paran is being used, that Hairlock wants both of them dead.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Toc and Lorn arrive in Pale. Toc tells her that rumor is that the Bridgeburners will be disbanded, which will be trouble. She recognizes the army is on edge of revolt. She and Dujek meet and he informs her Tayschrenn has ordered a more-than-usually-severe culling of the nobles and that he (Dujek) has had several attempts on his life. Lorn wonders why the Empress/Tayschrenn seem to be pushing him into rebellion, especially as their homeland is on the verge of the same. Dujek and Lorn agree the Moranth alliance with the Empire seems tenuous. Lorn tells Tayschrenn to lay off Dujek, that he and a handful are the only exceptions to the general idea that the “old guard” of the Emperor must die. Tayschrenn tells Lorn Oponn is meddling in Darujhistan, that he suspects Whiskeyjack and Tattersail of being in league, and that Paran is likely dead though not passed through Hood’s Gate yet. The section closes with Lorn recalling bad history with Tattersail in Mock City nine years earlier during the cleansing of the Mouse quarter.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Tattersail muses on several topics:</p><ul><li>She’s glad she missed the chaos and death in Pale, a scene she’s seen before.</li><li>That the Empire would soon turn Pale’s past rulers into “demons.”</li><li>She hopes, to her surprise, that Whiskeyjack and the others find their way free of Empire.</li><li>The mutual attraction between her and Paran.</li></ul><p>She’s invited to a dinner with Dujek, Lorn, Tayschrenn, and Toc and learns from Paran’s reaction that he’s working for Lorn.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>The dinner. Lorn informs Tattersail that when Lorn was eleven, she was in the Mouse Quarter when Tattersail and the other mages purged it and that her mother, father, and brother died afterward. Lorn tells Dujek that Tattersail’s cadre of mages was sent into the Old City to cleanse it of magic-users, but they were “indiscriminate.” Tattersail replies it was their first command and they lost control and that she resigned as an officer the next day, but that if the Adjunct wishes to execute her, she’d accept it as just penalty. Lorn says fine but Dujek says no, especially as the list of far too great of those who’ve committed crimes in the Empire’s name. He then tells them he’d gone down to reign in the mages at Whiskeyjack’s command. Tayschrenn tells Lorn the minute she became Adjunct her personhood as Lorn, as that young girl, ceased to exist. Toc thinks to himself as he saw the Adjunct slow acceptance, that he had witnessed an execution.</p><p>Tattersail informs them Oponn and Shadowthrone are in the fray over Darujhistan but lies about why the Hound was in her room. Toc notes the lie but doesn’t rat her out, paying back the times the mage cadre had taken so much for the lives of the 2nd Army.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Tattersail thinks of how she’s changed since that night in the Mouse Quarter and how she’d been given a second chance. Paran relays a message from Hairlock that Lorn arrived with a T’lan Imass and that Hairlock would track the two of them when they left Pale. Paran confesses to her his mission to find Sorry, though she suspects there is more to the Adjuncts arrival than the hunt for Sorry, that the plan was to kill Whiskeyjack and his squad. She worries Hairlock knows more than he said and decides she needs to warn Whiskeyjack and Quick Ben about him and the Adjunct. She also tells Paran that she will leave what happens to Sorry up to Whiskeyjack. The two of them sleep together.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Lorn and Tool leave Pale. Tool informs her the T’lan Imass legions left Seven Cities after the conquest to exterminate a group of Jaghut. He alone survived among his clan and thus is “unbound.” He tells her like all the Imass, he knelt before the Emperor before the First Throne, that Dancer had been with the Emperor, and that the Logros Imass gathered minds and performed a binding, part of which entails not being able to disclose where the First Throne is. He also informs her that the Kron T’lan Imass is coming, marking the end of the diaspora, as it’s the Year of the Three Hundredth Millennium.</p><p>SCENE 9<br/>Crone flies over the Rhivi Plain toward Brood, noting that change was coming, a convergence on its way.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER TEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Toc meets Paran and tells him he is a soldier of the 2nd rather than a Claw. Paran tells him Tattersail is on the way to Darujhistan and believes Lorn means to kill Whiskeyjack and his squad, though he doesn’t agree. Toc says Lorn’s mission is well beyond killing Sorry and that the Bridgeburners days are numbered which will lead to mutiny and civil war. Paran decides to go to Darujhistan and Toc says he’ll go with him.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Tattersail is travelling by warren but something is deadening her magic. She finally exits the warren on the Rhivi Plain and finds Bellurdan, sent by Tayschrenn to intercept her. He tells her it was Tool’s Elder magic power that created a magical dead space. Tattersail asks Bellurdan what Tayschrenn sent him to Genabaris for and he tells her it was to seek an ancient Jaghut text Gothos’ Folly to learn about the entombment of a Jaghut tyrant near Darujhistan. She realizes Lorn’s task is to free the Jaghut, but Bellurdan argues they’re most likely trying to prevent that. They ready to fight and Tattersail opens her warren fully withinin the Imass’ area of influence, which consumes her and Bellurdan, though just before doing so she gets an idea from noting her own spell of preservation on the sack Bellurdan still carries with Nightchill’s remains.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Tool and Lorn, from a distance, witness a pillar of fire, a mixture of many warrens. When the fire dies, Tool says its source was destroyed but something also born.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Crone flies into Brood’s camp. Brood wears an enormous hammer reeking of power. They discuss tactics and the power on the Rhivi Plain from last night that all sensed. Crone tells him of Oponn’s meddling and that she knows the Coin Bearer. Brood decides to protect the Coin Bearer and try to prevent a confrontation between Rake and the Empire that would destroy Darujhistan. Brood leaves Kallor in charge, who mutters under his breath that Brood should destroy Rake and that would be his “last warning” to him (Brood does not hear it).</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Toc and Paran approach the scene of the fire. They find Tattersail and Bellurdan’s bodies embraced and charred. Toc notes small tracks leading away, tracks that appeared to have been made mostly by bone feet. Paran decides Tattersail’s death was Tayschrenn and Lorn’s doing. As they exit, Toc, as he has before, notes a powerful itch in his blinded eye.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Crone flies over the Rhivi Plain and sees bursts of power. Arriving, she receives a report from another great raven who tells her a shape-shifter puppet arrived on the plain via warren and has killed two ravens. Investigating, she is almost killed by Hairlock’s chaos magic then flies off to inform Rake.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Lorn and Tool watch the interaction between Hairlock and the ravens and Tool tells her whatever creature is using Elder magic (Hairlock), it appears to be tracking them. He tells her a convergence is happening and that power draws power, something the Jaghut and Forkrull Assail knew (the two founding races besides the Imass), though the lesson has escaped the Imass and humanity.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER ELEVEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>In his dreamscape, back at the “very beginning of things,” Kruppe meets Pran Chole, a Bonecaster of the Kron Tlan. Pran tells Kruppe that their wars against the Jaghut continue, with the Jaghut dwindling and in retreat; that the Forkrul Assail have vanished, that the K’chain Che’Malle are no more, that the T’lan are over hunting the herds. And also that they are about to perform the Rite of Imass, which will make the mortal T’lan into the undead and near-immortal T’lan Imass.</p><p>They are joined by a pregnant Rhivi women who tells them that the Tellann Warren of present day has birthed a child in a confluence of sorceries (Tattersail’s sorcery) and its soul needs a vessel. She says K’rul will help and he is using Kruppe’s dreamscape because Kruppe has somehow made his “soul immune” to interference from the Younger Gods. The child’s soul will be born a Soletaken (shapeshifter), akin to the T’lan Imass bonecasters. Tattersail appears in a horribly wrecked body and is informed of what they will attempt. K’rul appears and advises Kruppe that what the Malazans want isn’t necessarily clear and also warns Kruppe that Lorn and Tool approach the city with “destructive” purposes and that Kruppe should seek knowledge of them but not directly oppose them as others will do so. Tattersail is reborn via the Rhivi woman and when Pran bemoans that he won’t see the child grown to womanhood, K’rul tells him he will, in 300,000 years.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Kruppe hears a Malazan curse from the roadworkers outside of Baruk’s home.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Sorry tells Whiskeyjack that Kruppe, now walking away, is “vital” and possibly a Seer. The Malazans continue to plant mines under the roads as Whiskeyjack thinks about Sorry’s eeriness, her cold murderousness and feeling of being “old” and then thinks as well how she is a mirror to what he feels himself becoming—inhuman. He tries to hold up against despair for his men.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Crokus visits his uncle Mammot, who is writing a history of Darujhistan. Mammot tells him of the battles between the Jaghut and Imass and that a Jaghut’s barrow is rumored to lie in the hills near Darujhistan.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Sorry, following Kruppe, tries to get hold of herself after Whiskeyjack’s use of the word “Seer” had blossomed in her head, awakening a presence that is now losing a battle inside her, to the sound of a child weeping. She names herself “Cotillion” and soon buries the other presence, then continues after Kruppe, whom she considers dangerous, and, “all that is dangerous, she told herself, must die.”</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Kruppe wanders the market casting spells to steal food, then enters the Phoenix Inn.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Sorry kills a sort of lookout outside the Inn then goes inside.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Crokus finds the dead body.</p><p>SCENE 9<br/>Crokus enters and tells everyone of the murder. He figures out Sorry did it as Sorry figures out he’s the Coinbearer (when he pays for his ale).</p><p>SCENE 10<br/>Kalam meets Quick Ben and tells him he’s had no luck contacting the local assassins who have gone to ground. They discuss a plan of Quick Ben’s that will attempt to get a lot of Ascendants involved, though that’s usually something to avoid at all costs.</p><p>SCENE 11<br/>Kruppe, Crokus, Coll, Rallick, and Murillio are together at the Inn and they discuss rumors of an alliance with Moon’s Spawn and that it is home to “five black dragons.”</p><p>SCENE 12<br/>Quick Ben travels via warren to Shadowthrone’s realm and hears the baying of Hounds.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER TWELVE</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Kruppe reads in Mammot’s study about the ancient calling down of a god, its crippling, and its chaining, at which was present many Ascendants, including five black dragons and one red dragon. Baruk magically contacts Mammot and sets him a task as well as requests through him that Kruppe comes to meet. Kruppe leaves, thinking he needs to find out who was following him earlier (Sorry).</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Crone tells Baruk of her encounter with Hairlock on the Rhivi Plain and that Hairlock is seeking something. Baruk tells her of the Jaghut Tyrant buried in the hills and that his assumption is the Malazan Empire is seeking that power, but he isn’t willing to tell Rake exactly where the Jaghut is buried.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>In Shadowrealm, Quick Ben is escorted by Hounds of Shadow to Shadowthrone. He tells Shadowthrone that he was once an acolyte and knows he is under constant threat of assassination for leaving. He makes a deal to deliver to Shadowthrone Hairlock (who hurt the Shadowhound Gear) in exchange for having the assassination order lifted. At the end, Shadowthrone recognizes who Quick Ben is but too late.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Kruppe conveys to Baruk a message from the Eel to “look to the streets to find those you seek.” Baruk tasks Kruppe to gather Murillio, Rallick, Coll, and Crokus to spy on any activity in the Gadrobi Hills (where the barrow lies).</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Quick Ben returns to Darujhistan and tells Kalam he’s succeeded in his mission to Shadowthrone (we learn Quick Ben was a “high priest” of Shadow). Sorry arrives to tell them she’s found them an assassin (Rallick) at the Phoenix Inn and that she’ll be doing another assignment from Whiskeyjack. Quick Ben and Kalam agree Sorry is “the one we thought her to be.”</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>At the Inn, Rallick notes Kalam’s entry and goes to tell Ocelot, head of the local assassin guild. Ocelot tells him to lead Kalam to a warehouse as a trap.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Crokus begins to break into the D’Arle home to replace what he’d stolen from Challice.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Kalam and Quick Ben (invisible) follow Rallick to the warehouse, though both have a bad feeling about it.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Rallick tells Ocelot he’s brought Rallick and Ocelot prepares his assassins’ ambush.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>A demon belonging to Baruk is observing the rooftops where Kalam and Quick Ben are but is suddenly attacked, barely escaping as 12 assassins fall from the sky and begin killing Ocelot’s group of assassins.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Kalam and Quick Ben are attacked.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Rallick kills one of the mysterious assassins, whose body disappears. He and Ocelot head out.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Sorry watches Crokus at the D’Arle estate while musing over all the “potential players” she’d already eliminated: Paran, a Claw Leader in Pale, others. She knows Crokus should die but finds herself at war over that. She feels sorcery from the assassin attack across the city.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Crokus and Challice speak as he returns the loot and he tells her he will be in her line of suitors to be formally introduced. As he leaves with the alarm sounding, he sees Sorry watching him.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Kalam and Quick Ben continue their fight. Quick Ben uses one of Tayschrenn’s imperial demons (Pearl) to cover their escape. When Quick Ben tells Pearl his true name (Ben Adaephon Delat), the demon says he’s supposed to be dead, marked as killed by the Empire. Rake arrives and the demon turns to fight, knowing he will be killed.</p><p>SCENE 9<br/>Rallick walks the streets thinking of his (to him) inevitable future: becoming an assassin Guild Master and losing his sense of outrage at injustice. He thinks his plan to get revenge on those who hurt Coll will be his last humane act. He meets Crokus and tells him to tell his uncle that the guild’s best have been killed, that there is a Claw in the city, as well as someone from the sky killing everyone. He also tells him to quit stealing. Crokus leaves and Murillio arrives to tell Rallick of Baruk’s task. Rallick says he can’t go. They enter the Phoenix Inn.</p><p>SCENE 10<br/>The Tiste Andii assassins’ leader, Serrat, reports to Rake of their injuries and deaths to a Claw accompanied by a High Mage and of one fallen to Rallick. Rake is happy to hear the Claw and Guild were about to fight each other.</p><p>SCENE 11<br/>Quick Ben brings Kalam to the squad to be healed by Mallet. He tells Whiskeyjack, Fiddler, Hedge, etc. of the attack. They realize Rake was taking out the Guild so the Empire couldn’t use it.</p><p>SCENE 12<br/>Sorry heard the conversation between Rallick and Murillio. She decides to kill Crokus outside the city once she discovers their mission. She also decides she’ll have to deal with the threat of Quick Ben and Kalam.</p><p>SCENE 13<br/>Rake arrives at Baruk’s and tells him he’d been killing the local assassins (and hopes to kill the Guild Leader Vorcan) so the Empire wouldn’t contract them to kill Darujhistan’s leaders. Baruk tells Rake this is a bad idea as they keep the city in balance and yells at Rake for not consulting. When Rake expresses surprise at his temerity (“I’m unused to being addressed as an equal”), Baruk tells him “there are many paths to Ascendancy, some more subtle than others.” He informs Rake that Vorcan is a High Mage. Rake apologizes for not consulting.</p><p>SCENE 14<br/>In Kruppe’s dreamscape, K’rul tells him Tattersail is growing swiftly (greatly accelerated growth). He also tells him of Rake’s sword Dragnipur, “forged in darkness, it chains souls to the world that existed before the coming of light” and that Rake is the Knight of High House Darkness and in league with Baruk and the Cabal of mages—Darujhistan’s true leaders. He warns Kruppe to avoid the Imass or Jaghut and protect the Coin Bearer.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Tool explains to Lorn that he was chosen to help her free the buried Jaghut tyrant because it can enslave all those living on the continent and if they’d sent a Bonecaster, a Jaghut Tyrant and enslaved Bonecaster would have been unstoppable and would kill most of the gods. As Tool is without a clan, his enslavement would stop with him and not enslave the rest of his kin. He tells her the plan is to have Rake try and stop the Tyrant and thus weaken himself. He also relates the Tiste Andii are alien, coming to this world from Kurald Galain, the Warren of Darkness, where Mother Dark “sought something outside herself and thus was born Light”—causing her children to accuse her of betrayal. They either left or were cast out and while some still use the Warren of Darkness, others use Starvald Demalain—the “First Warren”—the home of dragons.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Kruppe, Crokus, Coll, and Murillio head toward the hills on their spy mission for Baruk.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Sorry follows Kruppe’s group, planning on killing Crokus as the Coin Bearer, though she has a bad feeling about where they’re heading.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Tool finds the barrow and plans to open it in the morning. Lorn realizes that Tool is telling the truth that humans came from the Imass, had inherited their world and worries that humanity will become like the current Imass, only “deliverers of death.” She also realizes the Jaghut, which according to Tool had abandoned the ideas of community, empire, of the “cycles of rise and fall, fire and rebirth,” would not have started the thousands-year-old war between Jaghut and Imass and that this Tyrant must have been more like a human than a regular Jaghut because he enslaved and destroyed. She wonders if this is a wise course.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Paran and Toc the Younger, following Lorn and Tool, come across the ravens killed by Hairlock days earlier. Toc has a vision of a “small shape,” a warren opening, an attack on him and his horse. He tells Paran he thinks they’re heading into an ambush.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Quick Ben, guarded by Trotts since Kalam is still injured, spies on Hairlock and wonders what he’s doing waiting on the Rhivi Plain.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Hairlock ambushes Paran and Toc, throwing Toc through a warren and closing it off. The sound of Shadow Hounds is heard.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Quick Ben, aware of the ambush, calls on Cotillion/Rope/Dancer through the link with Sorry and tells him Hairlock is on the Rhivi Plain, as per his agreement with Shadowthrone.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>As Tool works on opening the barrow, Lorn runs into Kruppe’s group and attacks, wounding Coll and knocking out Murillio, though not before he wounds her. Realizing she hadn’t needed to attack, she agrees to let them stay to recover then head back to Darujhistan in the morning.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Sorry/Rope tells Shadowthrone of Quick Ben’s news. ST tells Rope Quick Ben had been a high priest of Shadow, and Sorry thinks Ben will have to pay for his “many deceits.” She appears near Kruppe’s party in time to see the attack by Lorn and when Lorn leaves, heads toward the group to kill Crokus.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Hairlock, afraid of the approaching Shadow Hounds, tells Paran he’ll kill him later and opens a warren to flee through.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Quick Ben cuts the strings to Hairlock.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Hairlock collapses before he can enter the warren and begs Paran to throw him through and in return he’ll give Paran his life. Paran refuses. The Hounds tear Hairlock apart while a Great Raven swoops overhead. The Hounds turn to attack Paran but stop as Rake arrives. Rake tells the Hound Rood to leave and tell Shadowthrone not to interfere here, with the Malazan war, or with Darujhistan. The Hounds attack and Rake kills two (Doan and Ganrod). Shadowthrone appears and Rake tells him he’d warned the Hounds. He says while ST might be his match (especially if Rope is around) a fight would get “messy” and kin would try to avenge Rake. ST agrees but says Rope is involved, and his plans “extend far beyond Darujhistan, seeking to reach the Malazan Throne itself.” Rake says he’d rather Laseen on the throne than a servant of shadow and ST agrees to recall Rope, tells Rake Paran has a connection with Oponn, then leaves with his hounds. Paran tells Rake something of what happened with Oponn and when Rake examines him, he determines Oponn left “hastily” a while ago, that Paran is no longer their tool, but his sword is. He advises Paran to get rid of or break the sword when his luck turns.</p><p>SCENE 9<br/>Paran touches one of the dead hounds and gets its blood on his hands, sending him into Dragnipur’s warren, walking with numberless chained people pulling a huge wagon. A Hound attacks him but then leaves him. Paran talks to a man who says Rake killed him long ago, then says the Hounds are causing problems. Paran says he’ll try to do something and follows the chains all the way to below the wagon. Stumped, he calls on Oponn and forces him to help. Oponn (the male one) tells Paran the chains are held within the warren of Darkness—Kurald Galain—and perhaps getting the Hounds in there would free them. Using Oponn as bait, Paran gets the Hounds to plunge into the warren. They disappear and Paran appears back on the Rhivi Plain, where the Hounds’ two bodies have disappeared.</p><p>SCENE 10<br/>Sorry, now no longer possessed, appears near the group disoriented and seemingly not remembering anything since her possession back at Itko Kan. Coll convinces Crokus to head back to Darujhistan and take Sorry to his uncle Mammot.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Lorn surprised herself that she broke off the attack on Kruppe’s party. Tool arrives to say he’s found the barrow’s opening and as they begin to release it, expresses doubts as to the wisdom of doing so. Lorn agrees to ambivalence but they continue. Tool says his vows have been snapped by the Jaghut’s power and when he is done, he will leave to seek “an answer.”</p><p>SCENE 2 Sorry asks for a Darujhistan name, as she doesn’t know hers; Crokus names her Apsalar: goddess of thieves.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Kruppe and Murillio follow Sorry and Crokus as Kruppe explains Oponn has chosen Crokus and thus his need for protection, as well as his correct suspicions regarding what Lorn was doing at the barrow and Murillio and Rallick’s plan to return Coll to his place in Darujhistan society and avenge him.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Paran is attacked by Rhivi but through miraculous luck is unharmed. He meets Tattersail reborn (not a 5-yr-old, so growing abnormally fast) and she tells him who she is and that they’ll meet again.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Paran continues to Darujhistan, thinking he is now serving himself, not the Empire, and wonders if Sorry/Cotillion is an enemy anymore. He meets Coll and they agree to head into the city together. They share backstories.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER SEVENTEEEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Rallick meets an Eel’s agent (likely Circle Breaker) at the Phoenix Inn who tells him Orr, in the name of Lady Simtal, has hired the assassin’s guild, specifically Ocelot, to kill Coll.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Rake tells Baruk they won’t be able to avoid a fight and he plans to prevent Laseen from getting Darujhistan, but not at the cost of destroying the city as Baruk fears he’ll do. When questioned by Baruk as to what restrains him, Rake answers what drives him is duty to his people—to return to them “the zest for life.” They discuss the upcoming convergence of powers. Baruk shows Rake Mammot (revealed as a High Priest of D’rek) in a trance, which Rake explains means Mammot is trapped in the barrow.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Circle Breaker signals Meese outside the Phoenix Inn and continues to one last contact for the Eel, expecting he’ll be killed sometime tonight as he’s exposing himself so much.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Meese goes into Mammot’s house.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Crokus and Apsalar are in Mammot’s and Meese warns him D’Arle is looking for him due to the guard Sorry/Apsalar killed. Crokus thinks Challice betrayed him.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Murillio leaves Kruppe at the Phoenix Inn and is given a message from the Eel by Circle Breaker.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Rallick rubs Otataral dusk on his body to make him impervious to magic (though it has unpredictable side effects) then heads to K’rul’s tower to await Ocelot.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Whiskeyjack’s squad is discussing plans for Kalam to try and contact the Assassin’s Guild again. Quick Ben tells them he can’t “find” Sorry, which probably means she’s dead. The squad confronts Whiskeyjack with his attempts to stay sane by cutting himself off, taking away his soldiers’ humanity (from his perspective) so he doesn’t think of them as hurtful losses, and that such a method will drive him crazy eventually. Whiskeyjack sees this as an offer of friendship and he acknowledges he is “finally, and after all these years, among friends.”</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Coll and Paran arrive at an entry gate, Coll barely alive. He tells Paran to get him to the Phoenix Inn.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Rallick continues to climb toward Ocelot in the belfry.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Coll is unconscious. A guard recognizes him and agrees to help Paran get him to the Inn. Paran’s attention is caught by K’rul’s tower and he sees movement on it.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Rallick and Ocelot fight. Rallick kills Ocelot but not before taking a blade deep into his chest.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Paran turns away from the tower, seeing no more movement. The guard gets a wagon for Coll.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>The Tiste Andii Serrat awakens from having been blindsided while she was preparing to attack the woman outside Mammot’s house. She disappears into her warren.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Meese and Irilta discuss the arrival of Paran and Coll at the Phoenix Inn and that the Eel has told them to keep Crokus and Sorry/Apsalar at the Inn.</p><p>SCENE 9<br/>Paran, at the Phoenix Inn bar, considers what to do with his sword. He recalls a tutor telling him once that the gods get you by separating you from others (your human contact) then offering to end the isolation they helped create.</p><p>SCENE 10<br/>Kalam arrives in the bar and Paran orders him to get Mallet (the squad healer).</p><p>SCENE 11<br/>Mallet and Whiskeyjack arrive. Mallet heals Coll. Paran tells Whiskeyjack he and Tattersail figured out the squad had been set up to be killed and that Tattersail had been killed (“Tayschrenn got to her”). He also tells him he (Paran) is no longer Oponn’s tool though the sword is and that the adjunct has a T’lan Imass with her.</p><p>Whiskeyjack uses a magical artifact to contact Dujek. Dujek tells Whiskeyjack that Tayschrenn was “last happy” when Bellurdan and Tattersail killed each other (two more Old Guard down) and is wondering what is going on with Oponn, Rake, Shadowthrone, and some soul-shifted puppet. He also says Laseen is planning on dismantling Dujek’s army and setting him in command over in Seven Cities to deal with an impending rebellion. He informs Whiskeyjack that Lorn and Tool have reached the barrow and that if they release the Jaghut the squad is meant to be among the casualties. Finally, he says the Black Moranth are leaving Pale and Dujek is “ready to move” once Tayschrenn triggers events by disbanding the Bridgeburners.</p><p>Paran tells Dujek Toc was tossed into a warren and that Tayschrenn killed Tattersail. He wonders what Dujek and Whiskeyjack intend because he wants vengeance for Tattersail and for the adjunct betrayal of him. Dujek tells Paran the Empire loses Genabackis: the Crimson Guard will repel whatever army Laseen tries to send and the Moranth will no longer be her allies. He also says they’re going to take on a new player—the Pannion Seer—who is “damn nasty.”  Finally, he tells Paran to leave vengeance on Tayschrenn to someone else but feel free to deal with Lorn if he wants.</p><p>They break communication and Kalam expresses shock at all the secrets. Whiskeyjack tells him that plans changed when Lorn told Dujek of the reinforcements coming, which proved to Dujek that the Empire wanted the Bridgeburners dead. Whiskeyjack tells Paran Lorn must live to lure the Tyrant into the city, then afterward perhaps she can die.</p><p>SCENE 12<br/>In the Jaghut Tyrant’s tomb, Tool tells Lorn they’re looking for a “finnest” as “within it is stored the Jaghut Tyrant’s powers.” When he awakens he will hunt it down. Lorn’s sword will deaden its aura for a while, enough to get it into the city for the Tyrant to get lured into Darujhistan. They leave as the Jaghut begins to awaken.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER NINETEEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Crokus is getting restless and senses big things are happening. He and Apsalar sneak out from the Inn. Crokus plans on talking to Challice.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Serrat, waiting on the roof above the Inn, attacks Crokus as he climbs up. A mysterious force drives her away and over the roof’s edge, though she retains her invisibility/flight spells.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Crokus says he thought he felt/saw something, then shrugs and he and Apsalar continue.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Rallick gets to Murillio, who’s been waiting for him so they can put their plan into action to kill Turban Orr. Rallick tells him he killed Ocelot but was badly wounded. When they take off his armor, the wound has closed and the Otataral powder has disappeared from his skin. Murillio tells him to still rest due to lost blood while he heads off to confront the Eel, whom he now suspects might be Kruppe</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Kruppe and Baruk are meeting. Baruk tells Kruppe he’s considering finding out who Circle Breaker is because he needs to find the Eel to see if they can work together to save Darujhistan. Kruppe tells Baruk he’ll get the message to him to forestall Circle Breaker being found out.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Paran tells Whiskeyjack he thinks he’s figured out what Whiskeyjack and Dujek haven’t told him—that they plan on conquering Darujhistan themselves to use its wealth to fight whatever Laseen sends after them in reprisal. Whiskeyjack tells Paran they don’t care what Laseen does as they have bigger and worse fish to fry—the Pannion Seer.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Lorn leaves Tool to head into the city. She tells him her wound from Murillio is already nearly healed, thanks to her Otataral sword. She plans on seeking Sorry and then the Coin Bearer once she places the finnest in the city. She bemoans the loss of Paran, thinking of her attraction to him. She no longer has second thoughts.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Crokus and Apsalar entry K’rul’s belfry as a hiding place and discover Ocelot’s body. Crokus sees give winged shapes leaving Moon’s Spawn. Apsalar tells him about the oceans on the real moon and the underwater gardens on it and how one day the chosen will be taken there and there will be no wars or empires or swords.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER TWENTY</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Murillio worries Rallick has lost too much blood to kill Orr. He muses on a giant time-keeping device built over a thousand years ago by a part-Jaghut named Icarium who traveled with a Trell (another race). He runs into Kruppe (literally) who tells him Coll has been healed and gives him masks for Lady Simtal’s party—one for Murillio, one for Rallick, and Kruppe keeps one for himself. Murillio tells Kruppe he’s figured out Kruppe is the Eel and Kruppe magically makes him forget.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Baruk tries, to no avail, to convince Rake not to attend the party. Both expect a “convergence” of power. Rake learns the new year is called Year of the Moon’s Tears. When Baruk tells him not to worry, the name was given a thousand years ago, Rake tells him that’s not so long; in fact, Icarium (with his Trell companion Mappo) visited Rake 800 years ago. Rake also mentions the presence of Caladan Brood and Osric/Osserc (with whom Rake continued an “old” argument). Baruk hints he knows Kruppe is the Eel when a message comes from him.</p><p>Mammot has awakened from his trance/entry into the Jaghut barrow and Baruk tells Rake Mammot is one of the T’orrud mages. Mammot tells them he was caught “for a time” but not sensed by the Jaghut, and that he estimates two to three days before the Jaghut awakens fully. Baruk learns that it is Mammot’s nephew Crokus who is the Coin Bearer. Rake asks to make sure Mammot will be at the party (he will) then leaves abruptly.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Lorn enters the city and heads for Whiskeyjack and his squad. Her wound is healing less quickly than expected due to her time in the barrow.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Circle Breaker was one of the guards at the gate Lorn entered through; he notes she matches the description given him by the Eel. He switches jobs with the other guard so he can be at the party.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Lorn finds some of the squad at Quip’s Bar. Fiddler and Hedge, playing cards with a Deck, tell her they’ve been expecting her. Whiskeyjack arrives and tells Lorn they’ve mined the city, Tiste Andii assassins have been hunting them, and they lost Sorry. Lorn tells him Sorry was a spy and isn’t dead but in hiding because Lorn has been hunting her for three years. Lorn tells him she’s giving the orders now.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Lorn tells Whiskeyjack she doesn’t believe Rake and the Andii are in the city. She asks why the squad hasn’t taken out the rulers since the Guild deal isn’t going to work. Whiskeyjack says they’ve arranged to be guards at the party tonight with that possibility in mind. Lorn realizes Whiskeyjack isn’t “broken” as she’d expected. She leaves, saying she’ll return in two hours.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Quick Ben says Kalam is getting impatient on his mission, Trotts says he’s been successful in his, and Whiskeyjack tells Quick Ben Lorn didn’t drop off something Paran had expected her to.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Apsalar and Crokus are waiting in K’rul’s tower before heading to the party so Crokus can talk to Challice. Both realize Apsalar is at war in herself but she tells Crokus she thinks everything is okay, she’s holding things together.</p><p>SCENE 9<br/>Serrat, about to attacks Crokus and Apsalar, is instead taken by surprise and told to warn Rake to leave Crokus alone—the message is from someone Rake/Serrat know who is not as far away as he once was and also comes “compliments of the Prince.” Serrat leaves and Crokus thinks he felt something.</p><p>SCENE 10<br/>The Jaghut (Raest) awakens and remembers his rise to power, enslavement of the Imass, attack by other Jaghut who imprisoned him. He rises and goes after the Finnest.</p><p>SCENE 11<br/>Crone witnesses five dragons above the barrow’s hills.</p><p>SCENE 12<br/>Raest causes an earthquake by sending a spear of pain into Burn, the goddess who sleeps deep in the earth. The dragons confront him, led by Silanah red-wings, whom Raest distinguishes as “true-blooded Tiam” as opposed to the four Soletaken dragons, “whose blood is alien to this world.” They fight.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Lorn plants the Finnest acorn in a garden. She imagines the death and destruction about to be visited upon Darujhistan and feels herself breaking down. She sets off to kill Crokus and take the Coin, her “last act.”</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Kruppe heads toward the party, thinking of how “someone” is protecting Crokus perhaps even better than Kruppe has been. He also plans to let Circle Breaker retire tonight after the party, which he feels will be a crux for future events.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Crokus and Apsalar head for the party.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>The squad is hired at the party. Quick Ben tells them the Jaghut has been freed and is winning whatever battle it’s fighting out in the hills.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Kalam and Paran, at the Phoenix Inn, discuss killing Lorn. Kalam tells Scurve the bartender to get a message the Assassin’s Guild master that a big contract is waiting for them at the party. They head to the party.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Baruk and Rake head to the party. Baruk marvels at the power of the battle outside the city and that Rake seems so calm despite the fact that Raest is clearly winning and will be in the city in hours.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Lady Simtal and Turban Orr meet Baruk and Rake (who is wearing a dragon mask) and welcome them. (Orr doesn’t recognize Rake’s name and is suspicious of Baruk’s power and influence.)</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Murillio and Rallick hope Baruk doesn’t see them. They watch as Kruppe heads toward Rake and Baruk.</p><p>SCENE 9<br/>Baruk tells Rake Kruppe is the Eel. Kruppe reveals he knows Rake is a Soletaken dragon. (Baruk thinks the mask is merely a mask.)</p><p>SCENE 10<br/>Orr recognizes Circle Breaker and realizes he’s the spy Orr has been seeking. Before he can move to kill him, Rallick crashes into Orr and provokes him into a duel.</p><p>SCENE 11<br/>Murillio and Lady Simtal are in her bedroom.</p><p>SCENE 12<br/>Rake steps in to be Rallick’s second in the duel. Mammot, wearing a Jaghut mask, joins Baruk.</p><p>SCENE 13<br/>The squad realizes Rake is there. Quick Ben tells Whiskeyjack the magical battle outside the city is wreaking havoc among all the magic-users, including him. They can’t protect themselves by using their barrows because the Jaghut, even at this distance, would “take the weaker ones.”</p><p>SCENE 14<br/>Crokus arrives, after leaving Apsalar at the garden’s back wall. He joins the crowd waiting for the duel, standing next to Circle Breaker. Kruppe arrives and gives Circle Breaker a message from the Eel, which is about his lucrative retirement in a different city via the Eel. Rallick kills Orr easily then leaves. Baruk introduces Rake to the witch Derudan, who worries about the Jaghut. Rake tells them his concern isn’t with who is beyond the city walls.</p><p>SCENE 15<br/>Rallick bursts in on Murillio and Simtal (after the sex) and tells Simtal that Orr is dead, that Coll will be returned to his status/house. Rallick leaves, then Murillio as well, though not before leaving Simtal a dagger, knowing she’ll commit suicide. He already starts regretting what his vengeance makes him feel like.</p><p>SCENE 16<br/>Crokus grabs Challice and brings her into the garden.</p><p>SCENE 17<br/>Circle Breaker leaves, happy.</p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Two</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Raest enters Kruppe’s dreamworld and faces Kruppe, Tool, and K’rul. He disappears into “another body.”</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Kalam and Paran find Apsalar in the garden glade. Apsalar vaguely recalls killing Paran and that Kalam is an “old friend.” All three recognize there is something strange about what they’d taken as a stone bench but turns out to be a wooden block that is growing where Lorn planted the Finnest. Whiskeyjack orders Fiddler and Hedge “loose.”</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Rallick runs into Kruppe, who tells him his “destiny awaits him” and also that the world is “well-prepared” for Raest, which makes no sense to Rallick. Rallick then meets Vorcan, who is surprised that Rallick could overcome Orr’s “protective magic,” then decides that Rallick’s “skills are required.”</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Crokus learns Challice didn’t betray him, that he doesn’t really love her. He goes to find Apsalar.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Mallet can’t enter the glade because the wooden oddity (now the size of a table) “hungers” for him. Mallet confirms Apsalar is no longer possessed and that she has “somebody else inside” who has been there “all along” protecting her. The other presence is trying to erase/cover the memories of Apsalar’s actions as Sorry but needs help as it is dying. Paran orders Mallet to help (Mallet’s preference as well). Vorcan and Rallick enter the glade.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>The wooden structure (later identified as an Azath) has no effect on Rollick (he actually slows its growth) due to the Otataral dust. Kalam offers the Empire’s proposal to Vorcan to have her and the guild kill the T’orrud Cabal of mages that rule Darujhistan. Vorcan informs them of her assumption that Baruk and the Cabal have allied with Rake and that Moon’s Spawn has been involved fighting Raest. Kalam tells her the Malazans are just as happy to let Rake take Raest on, and that she needn’t try to kill him. Vorcan personally accepts the proposal (outing herself as a High Mage) and then orders Rallick to stay near the Azath to slow its growth. Crokus, who has overheard, comes out when Rallick is alone (the Azath now looks like a small house). Rallick tells Crokus to warn Baruk and Mammot about Vorcan.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>In the carriage, Rake tells Baruk Raest is weakened and while he’ll keep an eye on the situation, he thinks the mages can handle it. He then warns Baruk to clear the streets and asks for a point of high vantage. Baruk sends him to K’rul’s tower.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Mammot is revealed as Raest-possessed. Quick Ben stops him from incinerating a female mage (Derudan) who then momentarily stuns Mammot and tells Quick Ben it’s up to him as that was all she had. In the attack, Whiskeyjack’s leg is broken, Paran’s sword absorbs a “lance of energy” and Paran disappears, and many partygoers are killed.</p><p>SCENE 9<br/>Paran finds himself in a strange place (Warren, I assume?) and is witness to a large house rising out of a lake. He looks on as Tool and the Finnest (an oak-fleshed Jaghut figure) fight. Tool asks Paran to defend the Azath (the house) which is meant to imprison the Finnest. Paran tries to block the Finnest’s power with Chance, but the sword has no effect. Instead, the Omtose Phellack Warren magic awakens the Hound’s blood in Paran and Paran leaps onto the Finnest and tears it apart. Tool pulls Paran back and the Azath takes the Finnest via roots rising from the earth to pull it down into the ground.</p><p>SCENE 10<br/>Paran reappears at the party. Quick Ben uses seven Warrens and strikes at Mammot. Hedge uses munitions on the weakened Mammot.</p><p>SCENE 11<br/>Crone circles over where Raest had vanished into Kruppe’s dreamworld. She hears Silanah cry out and Crone sees what Silanah does and her response is joy and surprise.</p><p>SCENE 12<br/>Looking into the crater formed by Hedge’s munitions, Quick Ben and the others see a “man-shaped form coalescing” at the bottom of the pit. Roots from the Azath in the glade pull the form (Raest) into the garden. Derudan leaves. Kalam realizes the problem with planting munitions in Darujhistan.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Paran finds himself suddenly in Shadow Warren, attacked by the Hound Rood, who is “confused” by some “kinship” between Paran and Rood, according to Cotillion. The Rope distinguishes between his use of Sorry (“she knew it not”) and the less “merciful” use of Paran by the Twins. He admits, though, that his original plan was “flawed” and he plans to start a new one. Paran gives him the sword Chance. Cotillion tells Paran “try not to be noticed.” Paran returns to the garden and tells Mallet he’s going after Lorn.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Crokus, mourning Mammot’s death, runs to Baruk’s place. Above him, barely above the rooftops, hangs Moon’s Spawn.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Lorn has sensed the “death” of Raest and bemoans the fact that Whiskeyjack probably still lives, though she thinks they (she, Laseen, Tayschrenn) can deal with that once they control Darujhistan. Before she heads after Crokus (the Coin Bearer) to kill him, she deploys “Tayschrenn’s gambit”: a demon Lord of the Galayn which she orders to attack Rake.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Baruk mourns the death of Mammot, though celebrates that Rake didn’t use his sword on him and that he sensed Mammot’s last thought was “relief.” Derudan arrives at Baruk’s and tells him of the Azath, Mammot’s death via Hedge’s munitions, and Quick Ben’s seven Warrens. Both feel the release of the demon lord (Baruk realizing this was the danger Rake had anticipated) and then the deaths of two of the cabal, which Baruk informs Derudan comes at the hands of Vorcan.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Rake, atop Krul’s tower, feels the demon lord’s release and sends Silanah back to Moon’s Spawn. K’rul appears and both share a feeling of being lost “in this world, in this time.” K’rul says he cannot help as he can only manifest at the temple and in Kruppe’s dreams. Rake promises to try and save the temple. The demon lord “veers” into dragon shape and Rake does the same. As he heads toward battle, he feels Vorcan’s attacks on the mages but mistakes them as the mage from the Crimson Guard (Cowl).</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Kalam stops Fiddler and Hedge in time. They see the demon lord approaching and recognize it as Tayschrenn’s. They run.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Lorn tries to attack Crocus, but is prevented by one of his Crimson Guard watchers (Blues). Another (Fingers) escorts Crokus to Baruk’s and tells him the coin is Oponn’s and warns him to dump the coin if his luck turns.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Lorn runs from Blues and is killed by Meese and Irilta.</p><p>SCENE 9<br/>Paran finds Lorn, takes her Otataral sword. The Twins appear and wonder why Shadowthrone, the Rope, and the Hounds spared Paran. Paran faces them down and they leave; he carries Lorn away.</p><p>SCENE 10<br/>Rake attacks the demon lord.</p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Four</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Crokus is rebuffed by Baruk’s ward. Before he can enter another way, he’s interrupted by the demon lord dragon crashing to the ground nearby, knocking a hole in Baruk’s wall. The demon veers back into his shape and tells Rake (who has appeared behind Crokus) that the Empress will let him leave. Rake refuses. Rake kills the demon but is wounded; he tells Crokus to go protect Baruk, who is in danger.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Derudan and Baruk have felt yet another of their fellow mages die. Vorcan arrives but before she can attack is attacked herself by Serrat. Vorcan kills Serrat, strikes Derudan with a blade dusted in white paralt poison, and is about to kill Baruk when Crokus knocks her out with two bricks. Baruk saves Derudan with the only antidote to the poison and then notices Vorcan is gone.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Whiskeyjack contacts Dujek via the bone phone. Dujek tells him he knows Rake killed the demon lord because Tayschrenn is in a temporary coma. Whiskeyjack tells him Lorn’s gambit with the Jaghut failed, they’ve decided not to detonate the mines due to the gas, and that they’re pulling out. Dujek says they’re about to lose Pale, Seven Cities is a week from rebelling, and the Empress has outlawed Dujek, who is supposed to be arrested and executed (they intercepted a messenger from Laseen to Tayschrenn). He says he’s parleying with Brood and Kallor tomorrow to see if they’ll attack or let Dujek go or join him against the Pannion Seer. He also says the Black Moranth are on Dujek’s side.</p><p>Dujek promotes Whiskeyjack to second-in-command, puts Paran in charge of the Bridgeburners. He tells Paran Whiskeyjack and the squad have earned the right to walk if they want. All tell Paran they’re with him, but Fiddler and Kalam say they’re going to take Apsalar home. Coll wakens and offers them his help in getting out of the city.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Rallick, back in the garden as the Azath grew into a house with a yard filled with mounds, one of which the roots had pulled a man-shaped figure into. Vorcan appears, wounded, chased by Tiste Andii. Rallick picks her up and runs into the house.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Korlat and the other Tiste Andii arrive too late. Korlat says there is precedence for the Azath allowing Rallick in; the Deadhouse in the Empire had let in Kellanved and Dancer. Though Rake could destroy the Azath while it’s still young, Korlat decides to leave it.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Kruppe and Murillio watch Moon’s Spawn head west. Crokus joins them and tells them Rallick is in the garden and Apsalar’s been kidnapped by Malazans. Crokus tells him not to worry, and also that Gorlas saved Challice at Simtal’s estate.</p><p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Mallet and Whiskeyjack watch Moon’s Spawn depart. Mallet worries he hasn’t fully healed Whiskeyjack but Whiskeyjack tells him later. Quick Ben has a plan he’s keeping from Whiskeyjack.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Paran, wearing the Otataral sword, vows he’ll come to Tattersail once they deal with the Pannion Seer. He hears her in his head saying she’ll wait.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Crokus joins Kalam, Fiddler, and Apsalar in the boat heading to Unta to take Apsalar home. Crokus drops Oponn’s coin in the water. Circle Breaker watches from the bow.</p><p><strong>Prologue</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>A raider ship, Rheni’s Dream, is sailing the Sea of Storms south of Malaz Isle, fleeing before the sea-demons known as Stormriders. The ship, buffeted by wind, rain, wave, and hail, is becoming encased in ice, slowing the ship and killing the crew. This even though the captain, Murl, has done all the offerings “save the last,” which involves dropping a crew member overboard, something Murl refuses to do. Just before dying himself, Murl sees a rider:</p><blockquote><p>“a dazzling sapphire figure . . . helmeted, armored, a tall lance of jagged ice at the hip. It’s mount . . . half beast and half roiling wave.”</p></blockquote><p>Murl thinks the Riders are “answering some inhuman summons,” throwing themselves against the island of Malaz—”the one thing that had confined them so long to this narrow passage.”</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Edgewalker, “an elder inhabitant of the Shadow Realm,” walks across Shadow to a menhir where Jhedel, former King of Shadow, is imprisoned by having his two hands sunk into the rock behind his back. Through their conversation, we learn Jhedel killed someone to take the Throne but was eventually bound in return. Edgewalker tells Jhedel he is also “bound just as tightly” and that he senses a “new” power, possibly eyeing the Throne. After Jhedel is struck down by power (from his attempt to escape), he curses Edgewalker and demands to be released. When Edgewalker walks on, Jhedel swears to destroy him and everyone else. Edgewalker ignores him, thinking that he has long worried about the absence of an occupant on the Throne and sensing that change is perhaps on the way.</p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Temper, a guard at Mock’s Hold and a former veteran of Seven Cities warfare, muses on the sudden arrival of a female Imperial Fist a few days ago. Rumors abound: the garrison commander Pell would be replaced, Mock’s Hold would be activated as a command base for a new campaign against Korel, the old campaign had failed and the ship held the retreat from Korel, the ship held Emperor Kellanved himself, absent for several years now. Temper had watched as hooded figures, familiar to him as Claws (the Empire’s assassin-mages) disembarked. His memory of the Fist’s arrival is interrupted by his relief, Lieutenant Chase. Temper flashes back to the Seven City campaign, when he and Dassem Ultor (the First Sword) had entered the Palace of the Holy One and found three claws torturing her. Ultor infuriated the Claws by immediately and mercifully killing the Holy One.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Temper returns to the barracks where he’s forced to listen to Larkin, a Genabackan veteran whom Temper has been having issues with, regale the troops yet again with stories of his battles, this one involving the Crimson Guard with Larkin claiming to have fought an Avowed, Lazar. Temper doesn’t buy for a moment that Larkin fought Lazar and remembers how Dassem had slain all the Avowed he’d fought save Skinner. Temper puts Larkin in his place, but in doing so caused blood to drip on the Bones (a tile game), specifically Soldier, Maiden, King, and Obelisk, which he takes as a bad omen.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>A young girl, Kiska, watches an Imperial message cutter at the docks which obviously denotes someone high up aboard. She longs to join the Imperial army somehow, but has already been rejected by Pell. As she watches Claws disembark, she is grabbed from behind by one who asks what she’s doing. She tells him she’d like to meet the high up official to be hired. The Claw tells her to ask Pell and disappears.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Temper exits Mock’s Hold, but only after being inspected by a Claw at the gate (the gatekeeper Lubben had tried to warn Temper).</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Kiska continues to watch the cutter. She recalls being locked away a year ago by her Aunt Agayla when the Malazan army had arrived to deal with the chaos after the Regent (Surly) had outlawed magic and their was mass rioting and slaughter in the Mouse. She knows her aunt probably saved her life but also saw it as a chance to join the army and leave Malaz Isle. She watches as the official leaves the cutter w/ bodyguards, then waits while a mage appears from nowhere and follows the official. Kiska follows the follower.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Temper runs into Rengel, a retired marine and sail-maker, who warns him to stay inside tonight because it’s the night of the Shadow Moon, when the “souls of the dead come out,” demons roam the streets, “damned souls escape and new ones get caught,” and magic-users get “snatched.” Rengel points to a strange mark on his door, then goes inside. Temper continues on to the tavern whose above-rooms he rents: The Hanged Man Inn. He thinks of how Kellanved and Dancer have been missing for years. As he nears the Inn, he sees the Deadhouse, an abandoned stone house (the oldest building in the city), where Kellanved, Dancer, Dassem, Surly/Laseen, and other had done their planning for the Empire’s beginning. Temper enters the tavern and gets a drink from the innkeep, Coop, then asks him about a woman veteran named Corinn, whom he he’d first met a month ago and hasn’t seen for a while. A stranger is in Temper’s usual seat, and Temper notices he’s a Bridgeburner, someone Temper might have met in “earlier days, a different life.” He thinks of how he left that life a year ago, his place in the ranks “taken away from him,” and how he’d gotten false papers so he could be taken on at the local garrison. Heading up to his room above the common room he realizes some of the crowd below are pirates from Jakata, the island’s other major settlement and he thinks the ex-Bridgeburner has probably joined them.</p><p><strong>Chapter Two</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>The fisherman tells his wife he needs to go out because things are “all out of balance.” His wife fears for him. He lights a brazier and heads out, asking her to sing for him.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Fisherman reaches his skiff and sets the brazier in an iron stand on the boat. When he realizes the boat is covered in ice, he lays a hand on it and melts the ice, then takes the rowboat out to sea into the hail and waves and wind, none of which appear to touch him or his boat. He faces north into the storm and sings.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Kiska loses sight of the graycloak that had seemingly popped out of a warren and is tailing the mysterious person who had arrived on the imperial message cruiser. She follows him to a meeting in a manor courtyard, which she spies on. She sees her target sitting with an old man.They talk for a while then her target leaves to walk to the front of the estate. She turns away for a moment then turns back to see the mage she’d lost track of rising from the old man’s body then disappear. She goes to the body, stabbed twice in the back and obviously dead, and is rifling it when it grabs her.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Corinn calls Temper into her room and tells him what she’s about to do is meant to save his life. She reveals she’s a Bridgeburner and that she recognized him from Y’Ghatan and the Sword’s fall. Before they can really talk, Ash (a comrade of Corinn) appears and announces Temper is his prisoner.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Temper is sat in the common room with Coop (barkeep), Trenech (dimwitted giant), and Faro Balkat (old man), who appears to be asleep with his eye open. Ash and his mixed band of veterans and thugs—about 30—are seemingly waiting for something. Temper flashes back to Dassem Ultor thrust through at Y’Ghatan. A hound’s massive cry echoes through and discomfits everyone. Faro Balkat announces “The Shadow Moon is Risen.”</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Kiska suddenly finds herself in a canyon, where she speaks with the “dead” old man. He tells her they’re in the Shadow Realm and also on Malaz—the two realms are overlapping in a Convergence. He tells her his name is Oleg and he was a scholar who shared his knowledge with Kellanved (a master of Warren manipulation, Oleg says), who then betrayed him and left him for dead. He informs her the Emperor is returning with Dancer to the island tonight to enter the Deadhouse to claim Shadow, though Laseen and the Claws think he’s returning to reclaim the Empire’s throne. He tells her to tell the man he was speaking with in the courtyard that Dancer and Kellanved must be stopped, that Kellanved plans to “lose all to gain everything” and his “victory will be sealed by his defeat.” Also that “transubstiantion” is the time to strike and “entomb” the Emperor. Kiska returns to the courtyard. The grey cloak assassin reappears and tries to strangle her—to “send her to [his] master.” Oleg’s shade casts a spell at the assassin and drives him off. She decides to head to Agayla’s. As she decides, she hears a hound baying and screams.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Ash and most of his men depart, leaving a few behind to guard the prisoners. The guards get jittery and a fight appears about to ensue when the hound’s baying and the seeming disappearance of the outdoor guards pulls the inside guards together.Faro appears to be casting magic. When one of the guards threatens to kill Faro, Trenech kills the guards. Faro tells Temper and Coop to leave and that “Shadow—and Others—come.” Coop faints and Temper begins to carry him away.</p><p><strong>Part of Chapter Three</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Out on the sea, Fisherman fights glaciers and stormriders and stormrider mages. He is succeeding but appears overmatched.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>On her way to Agayla’s, Kiska is overrun again by shadows and Convergence and finds herself back in the Shadow realm, where she sees a glacier. Edgewalker appears and says he “walks the borders of Kurald Emurlahn [shadow].” He says he will send her back but before he does she tells him of Oleg and his belief someone would try and take Shadow’s throne tonight. Edgewalker says many have tried and all failed, ”even those who succeeded for a time. Myself included…“ A Hound bays and Edgewalker says it has her scent and she needs to run. When she asks about entombment, he tells her it is the “price of failure. Eternal enslavement to Shadow House.” He sends her to Obo’s tower back in Malaz as protection against the Hound, though when she arrives the tower is no longer ruins and the land no longer has a city on it. Obo, an old man, tells her the hound is gone and to basically “get off my lawn” and goes into his tower. She realizes a nearby stone tomb is on the same spot as the Deadhouse would stand in Malaz City. She steps over a low wall around the tower’s grounds and is back in modern Malaz. She runs to Agayla’s home (whose door appears to have magical protections) and Agayla lets her in.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Kiska tells Agayla everything save her meeting with Edgewalker and Obo. Agayla tells her she knew Oleg and then tells her a tale of the Empire’s VIPs: that with Dassem’s death at Y’Ghatan (which some suspect Surly and the Claws had a hand in), Surly is next in line for succession; that Dancer and Kellanved haven’t been seen for years working on magic research and that some think them dead; that the two have been prophecied to return; and that in that belief many “parties and interests have gathered.” She tells Kiska her grey-cloaked assassin isn’t a Claw but a Shadow Cultist.<br/>Kiska flashes back to the riot scenes when Surly outlawed magic, when Agayla had faced down a mob that came to arrest her for being a witch and then tells Agayla she won’t be locked away again as she had been that night. Agayla, distracted by ice forming over a basin of water near the fire and resigned to Kiska going out and trying to deliver Oleg’s message to the man she had tailed, gives her another message to deliver to him and tells her to do what he says after he’s read it. She tells Kiska to wait while she prepares some things.</p><p><strong>Rest of Chapter Three</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Temper carries Coop to Seal, an army veteran healer. While there he borrows Seal’s great-Uncle’s armor, to use along with his helmet (which has been made clear is quite recognizable). He heads off after Ash’s group toward Mock’s Hold.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Kiska leaves Agayla’s. She flashes back to the Mouse riots when she interrupted a trio of thugs beating an old man. She won the fight but had been scared at how close it had been and recalls vowing it was the last time she’d risk herself for another. Back in present time, a Hound howls and she flees, leaping off a temple of Fener at one point, to a priest’s amazement. She sees a group of cultists and decides to follow them to see if they’ll lead her to her target (the one who met w/ Oleg and to whom Agayla has written). She finds one killed and notes a bird’s claw tattoo on the corpse. Moving on, she finds her target surrounded by bodyguards who themselves are surrounded by cultists. She watches the ensuing fight but then is taken from behind, gagged and tied up and hooded.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Unhooded, she finds herself in a room in an inn. Her captors are Ash and Corinn’s group (Kiska vaguely recognizes Corinn). Before things can progress much farther, the inn is attacked by a Hound. The Hound kills almost everyone (Ash and Corinn seemingly escape). The last veteran left pulls out a munition and Kiska escapes into the street just before the room explodes.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Temper hears a scream and finds a girl who begs him to help. As he holds her, she changes into a demon snakewoman. Temper is saved by Edgewalker, who advises Temper to stay indoors before leaving.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Temper washes himself in a fountain then heads toward Mock’s Hold then runs from a Hound’s howl. He comes across one of Ash’s gang staggering toward him who dies in front of him then grabs him and tells Temper the Hound had been following him and now is on Temper’s track. Temper runs.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>The Hound attacks Temper, mauling him badly. Temper manages to wound the Hound, then passes out as it prepares to spring.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Kiska is in shock and debates hiding for the night but rejects the idea and heads toward Mock’s Hold to find her target.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Kiska climbs a back way into Mock’s Hold, a crevice she’d found as a child. As she enters, she is grabbed and tied up by her target’s main bodyguard. She tells him she has a message for his boss from her Aunt. Her target questions her as to what her Aunt does at Winter’s Turn. When Kiska answers, “she weaves,” that seems to reassure her target, who introduces himself as Artan and his bodyguard as Hattar. He shows Kiska the message, a drawing of a Stormrider, and asks what she sees. He appears surprised a bit when she says she sees ice, then tells her he’s met Agayla several times a long time ago. Kiska tells Artan the message from Oleg, that Kellanved is returning for the throne of Shadow, not the Empire and that Edgewalker seemed to confirm this. She tells him a bit more but Artan says it’s just theory and too abstract for him to worry about. They leave her tied up and move on. She gets loose and plans to follow them.</p><p><strong>Chapter Four</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Toben (Fisherman) is killed by the Rheni’s Dream—the ship from the prologue—which, encased in ice, smashes his skiff. The Stormriders head toward Malaz.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Agayla goes to Toben’s hut where she finds Toben’s wife frozen dead.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Agayla meets Obo overlooking the shore and tells him Toben was overcome. Obo blames Surly for outlawing the magic which had kept the Stormriders away. Agayla says Surly didn’t know, nobody knew. When he threatens to return to his tower Agayla says because he’s “anchored” himself to his tower, he has no choice but to commit to stopping the Stormriders. He says the two of them aren’t enough and she replies she’s asked another to help. At first he thinks it’s “that raving maniac” but Agayla says that one has chosen another path.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Temper flashes back to the assault on Y’Ghatan before Dassem’s death. Temper tells his friend Point that Dassem has sworn this is his last battle. Point scoffs then mentions how Dassem has a close connection to Hood. Dassem exits his battle tent with A’Karonys, Bedurian, Nightchill, and Hairlock, while Surly stays in the tent. The battle commences with Dassem at one point handing off control to his sub-commanders, including Whiskeyjack. Temper asks him if it’s truly his last and when Dassems replies in the affirmative Temper wonders how he can “just walk away.” Dassem answers Hood has more than enough people to do his work and that Hood “made a mistake,” that all that ever mattered to Dassem had been taken.</p><p>In the final push, the Y’Ghatan patroned champion Surgen fights with Dassem then Temper sees a “flash” and Dassem reacts as if wounded while Surgen is also startled by whatever it was. Dassem wounded, his guards fight to protect him with Temper taking on Surgen long enough for their squad to be rescued.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Temper awakes to find the cultist leader standing above him holding Temper’s helmet. The cultist says his people had watched Temper’s fight with Rood the Hound and had “intervened” then healed Temper. The cultist refuses to tell Temper who he is but says the two of them have the Claws as a common enemy. While the cultist converses with another, Temper starts to make connections to the Shadow Cult and the Talons and Kellanved and Dancer. The cultist leader shows Temper the Deadhouse and calls it a door, telling him he who passes through will command the Shadow Warren. He asks Temper to help the cultist help someone who will try to enter before dawn. Temper refuses and is allowed to leave.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Temper is escorted to Mock’s Hold by two cultists. He realizes the group has gathered for the Return of Kellanved, though Temper believes it’s to gain the Empire’s throne back, not some Warren. The cultists leave him at the Hold, telling him he’ll only find death there. Temper enters, thinking back to how Dassem always spoke warily of the Emperor and then he remembers the times he himself saw him, and the Emperor’s power. He flashes back again to Y’Ghatan.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>In the flashback, Temper awakens wounded in an infirmary tent. Ferrule is there and tells him via sign that the Claws and Surly have made their move and Dassem is in danger. The two of them kill the Claws in the tent, then go to where Dassem is kept. Inside that tent they find Dassem near death and Surly and more Claws, including Possum. Surly tells them Choss has been promoted to HIgh Fist and that Dassem is no longer needed, that Y’Ghatan is about to fall. Surly and Temper clearly know each other’s outward courtesy is false and when Surly exits the tent, leaving her Claws behind, a fight ensues in which Dassem seemingly kills Possum. The three of them escape and Dassem then separates to “travel” west. Later, the official story is put out that all three died at Y’Ghatan.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Kiska goes to Lubben’s room. He tells her there’s a take-no-prisoners “war” going on above them in the Hold. He offers her refuge but she refuses, so he gives her a dagger. As she climbs higher, she comes across lots of dead: Ash’s mercenaries, Artan’s guards, Claws and one dying mercenary who tells her Surly is above. As she starts to head down she sees Temper fight two Claws, one of whom turns out to be Possum. Temper kills one Claw then Possum disappears. Kiska runs upstairs and into a room, where she finds Artan and Hattar. The three of them watch as Temper comes up then meets a cultist who converses with him. The cultist waves a hand and Corinn appears on the floor, barely conscious. Temper picks her up and leaves. When the cultist turns to face their direction, Artan recognizes him.</p><p>SCENE 9<br/>We go slightly back in time to Temper’s point of view. He climbs the Hold, passing the same bodies Kiska did just before him. He kills one Claw, then comes across Possum and another Claw. He kills the strange Claw and taunts Possum, who disappears. Dancer appears (the cultist Kiska and the other two had watched Temper converse with) and tells Temper they are on the same side and that he doesn’t want Temper to ruin the carefully scripted night. Temper asks about Corinn and Dancer agrees to give her to him in return for Temper returning to Pralt, the Cult leader, and doing what Pralt says, which will involve a fight of some sort. Temper agrees and Corinn appears. Temper picks her up and before leaving asks if Dancer and Kellanved are back for the Empire’s throne. Dancer answers the Empire was merely a short-term tool to achieve “greater things.” Temper brings Corinn to Lubben and heads out.</p><p><strong>Chapter Five</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Dancer reveals himself to Artan, and thus reveals Artan to be Tayschrenn. Tayschrenn says he is in Malaz and the Hold out of “concern for the Empire,” a stance he calls “long-term” and which Dancer refers to as “the worn conceit for neutrality” and Tayschreen serving himself rather than the long term. Before leaving, Dancer identifies Kiska as someone of “talent” and then warns Tayschrenn to stay where he is, as anyone upstairs would be considered a “participant.” As they wait, Tayschrenn asks Kiska about herself. Kiska says she began her apprenticeship when Agayla caught her trying to break into Agayla’s shop. Tayschrenn refers to Agayla as a “colleague” whom he knows more by reputation than personally. Tayshrenn wonders aloud about what’s to come, thinking Surly had set the trap but Kellanved had perhaps set it himself long ago for her, which Tayschrenn assumes Surly knows but neither she nor Kellanved can avoid. Oleg’s message seems to indicate suicide for Kellanved and Dancer, Tayschrenn believes, but he can’t imagine either accepting that. Their conversation is interrupted by the sound of Kellanved walking with his cane above them. After a feeling of immense pressure and a long silence, there’s a sudden impact above, a clatter, a “roar of rage,” followed by a women’s scream of “frustration and venom.” Tayschrenn, Hattar, and Kiska head upstairs.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Upstairs they enter a room filled with corpses. Surly sits in a chair while the Claw Possum wraps her wounded hand. The floor is covered with red powder. One corpse is Ash, who wounded Surly with acid. Kellanved’s cane is lying on the ground before the balcony, from which another Claw—Topper—enters, wounded as well. Surly indicates Kellanved and Dancer went over the balcony and tells the wounded Claw to organize a search party for the bodies. Tayschrenn tries to say Surly can’t be sure, but she interrupts that she is certain enough and it is “over and done.” Tayschrenn says he came to Malaz for a different reason than these events, which enrages Surly. She says she will take the throne and a new name. Tayschrenn acknowledges her as Empress, though Kiska says she can’t tell if it is sincere or mocking. Tayschrenn dismisses Hattar and Kiska so he and Surly can discuss matters.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Kiska asks what the red powder was and Hattar tells her it was otataral, which deadened magic use in the room. She asks Hattar what he has against her and he dismisses her, saying he lost three good friends and she has little to do with his mood. The two fall asleep.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Temper meets his two earlier Cultist escorts at the exit. One mocks him, Temper clouts him on the head, and when the Cultist pulls a knife on him, Temper takes it away and stabs the Cultist with it.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Temper is escorted to the Deadhouse where the line between worlds is seemingly blurred. On the grounds of the Deadhouse, the ground is heaving and the tree branches twisting. The Cultist leader, Pralt tells him they are on/in a “bridge” or “midway stage” between their world and Shadow. Pralt says they will make an assault on the House, which will be defended by all those who tried and failed (which he says would be all of them) to do the same. When Temper says they can’t win, Pralt says they’re only a diversion/bait, which is all Temper, the Sword, and Dassem always were. Before Pralt, another Cultist named Jasmine, and Temper can enter through the gate leading to the grounds, Faro Balkat and Trenech tell them to stop. Faro asks Pralt not to do this because they will “weaken the barriers” and then tells Temper if he goes in he won’t come out. Once they enter the grounds, Pralt and Jasmine disappear and Temper is alone while Trenech guards the gate with Faro, then Pralt and Jasmine behind him. The House door opens and out comes a giant.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Obo and Agayla are atop a rocky point and are met by Tayschrenn, whom Obo doesn’t like because he has “the stink of the worm.” But Agalya says Tayschrenn is free of all bindings. Tayschrenn says, pointing to the south and the stormriders, that it was worse than he’d imagined. Agayla says she and Obo are masking most of it from the island and then agrees when Tayschrenn suggests they’re losing. When Tayschrenn asks what had held it back prior, Agayla answers that he (referring to the Fisherman) had been overcome. Tayschrenn finds it hard to believe it could have been one man, unless it were Osserc, but Agayla says there are other ancient powers and implies Fisherman was one, but had been too diminished by Surly’s campaign against magic as he had little talent to draw upon. When Tayschrenn defends Surly, saying she couldn’t have known, Obo scoffs angrily and Tayschrenn admits he had a sense of unease at it but didn’t think it would be so dangerous and thought if he had tried to stop Surly she would have suspected him of conspiring with Kellanved. Agayla wonders when Tayschrenn will learn wisdom and give up politics. Tayschrenn says it’s an odd way to ask for his help and Agayla says they may not want his help, as if they fall then Tayschrenn will have to commit himself. Tayschrenn says he would step aside, despite the loss of life. Agayla (whom Tayschrenn labels a Power, along with Obo as well) meets his gaze and seems to show him the reality of what they’re facing. He sees a curtain of energy and a mass of “otherworldly ice.” Agayla says if Malaz falls, the Stormriders would dominate the seas, but more worrisome is the idea that they are after the House. At that fearful thought, Tayschrenn agrees to fully commit his strength.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Kiska wakes to find Corinn hovering over her, Lubben in the doorway, and Hattar gone. Corinn says Kiska was under a light ward but that Kiska had broken it herself, showing surprising resistance. Kiska tells them Surly won and Ash was dead, that Surly said Kellanved and Dancer fell to their deaths to the cliffs from the balcony. Lubben and Corinn look skeptical and Kiska starts to wonder herself. Corinn says there’s a big disturbance among the warrens and Kiska says it has to do with the Deadhouse probably. Corinn figures the Hold’s events were a diversion and that she and Lubben should go there. Kiska worms her way in by relating what Oleg had told her. Corinn takes Lubben and Kiska into her warren (Thyr, the Path of Light) to travel to the Deadhouse. Kiska sees it as a hall of mirrors, each reflecting a different image of her. Corinn says Kiska is a natural and the images are possibilities. Kiska regrets not learning more of magery from Agayla and when she thinks of her she sees an image of her on the shore. Agayla tells her “not now.” Corinn disappears and Kiska finds herself in Shadow again.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Kiska appears before a crystal outcropping that seemed to draw her in. Edgewalker steps in to save her. Looking away she sees a massive glacier. She asks about the crystal and the glacier and Edgewalker informs her the crystal is Shadow House (the heart of Shadow) and the glacier is alien but rumor says the Jaghut accidentally allowed it into the world when they used their ice-magic. When Kiska asks why he isn’t trying to stop Kellanved (“a madman”) from taking the throne, Edgewalker says the glacier is the more deadly threat and if those resisting it continue to weaken it may break through. He says she must go back and suddenly she’s in fog where she’s attacked by a cultist. Kiska kills the cultist. A Hound is in the mist and Kiska charges it but stumbles out into the area outside the Deadhouse.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Temper faces the Jaghut that just exited the Deadhouse. Temper heads to the gate but Trenech and Faro bar his way while the Cultists spread out the length of the low wall bounding the grounds. Before Temper can try to jump the wall, corpses suddenly tear free from the ground between the path and the walls while branches swing and warren power covers the walls. The Jaghut heads to the gate after knocking Temper aside. Temper starts to crawl toward a wall with hands grabbing him. He sees one cultist get grabbed from out beyond the wall, pulled into the grounds, and dragged underground. Before Temper can jump the wall, he’s knocked back down by a suddenly-appearing Claw (Possum) as a full-battle breaks out as some Cultists and Claws fight each other, Faro and Trenech fight the Jaguhut at the gate, and some Claws and Cultists fight together against the dead trying to escape over the walls. Temper is grabbed by a root and as he tries to struggle free he watches Cultists start to retreat and Claws take over outside the walls. Temper struggles against the tree trying to drag him under.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>Kiska comes to her senses with Oleg standing over her. She’s outside the rear wall of the Deadhouse grounds. Oleg is frantic over Kellanved so far escaping the Deadhouse defenses. He asks Kiska if Edgewalker is going to do anything about it and she says no. Oleg jumps over the wall and attacks Kellanved with warren magic. Something emerges from a mound and grabs Kellanved and begins to drag him to the mound as Oleg yells in triumph. Then Dancer appears and tosses Oleg onto Kellanved and his attacker. Dancer pulls Kellanved free and the two make it to the House while Oleg is dragged into the mound by the creature. Dancer enters the House and then Kellanved seems to compel Kiska forward. As she steps onto the wall she is jolted by a spark and falls back as the wall is struck with force and flame. Kellanved enters the House. Kiska runs to the front. She sees Faro and Trenech fighting the Jaghut and watches as a young Cultist is dragged in over the wall by an armored hand. Then the owner of the hand appears (Temper) and falls over the wall on her side, holding a tree branch. She sees Tayschrenn and Hattar coming out of the fog toward the gate, with Tayschrenn appearing exhausted. Tayschrenn tells her the Claw is finishing killing the Cultists and Kiska informs him of Dancer and Kellanved making it into the House. Tayschrenn impresses on her how she must be in error as he and Surly have agreed the two are dead. Tayschrenn says he needs to speak to the Guardian (Faro). As they talk, a Cultist kills Trenech and the Jaghut attacks the gate. Faro and Tayschrenn use their warren magic to hold it off and Hattar runs into the blinding energy and pulls Tayschrenn out hurt. He tells her they have to find the nearest healer and Kiska takes the lead.</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>Lubben and Corinn find Temper. They want to leave but Temper says they have to stop the Jaghut. Faro suddenly comes out of the warren energy at the gate, seeming a blackened, burnt to the bone corpse. But Faro speaks and tells Temper to step into the gap and “Receive the Guardianship.” Temper agrees. Temper tells Corinn to shied him from the warren energy so he can get into the gate. He and Lubben go through to face the Jaghut. The Jaghut badly wounds Lubben then she and Temper fight for a while. Temper realizes he and the Jaghut were alone and the House had become a pile of “megalithic blocks.” The constellations are strange overhead and he sees a glacier at the horizon. The Jaghut tells him “they’ve failed.” and identifies herself as Jhenna, telling him the Jaghut raised humans up from “the muck,” gave them fire, and shielded them from the K’Chain. She then says name his price to stand aside and she will give him riches, impossibly long-life, power. Temper refuses to be bought. She tells him she has brought them to her warren, Omtose Phellack, and that time does not pass there. Edgewalker appears and tosses a Stormrider wand to the ground, then announces that the riders have been beaten back, the Shadow Cult defeated, and that he himself will bar her way into Shadow if she tries that way. Jhenna tells Temper if he stands aside then Edgewalker must take his place. Edgewalker says that only applies to Shadow; all other paths would be available to her. Jhenna then tries to bribe Temper with news that Dassem lives and she could bring Temper to him. Edgewalker warns Temper of the ice and Temper realizes while Jhenna has been talking he’s been partially encased in ice. Jhenna attacks and Temper holds her off long enough for the House to reclaim her. She is dragged into the earth and Temper appears back at dawn at the regular Deadhouse with Corinn and Lubben there.</p><p><strong>Chapter Five</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Kiska wakes up in Seal’s room. Seal tells her he healed her, Hattar, and Tayschrenn, though he says Tay pretty much took care of himself. Seal says he has a message from them to her, but Kiska guesses it is that they are down at the wharf. Seal says yes and she heads out.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Kiska finds Hattar and Tayschrenn loading up the boat to leave and asks to be taken. They agree to take her into service. She heads off to tell Agayla and her mother.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Kiska finds Agayla exhausted. Agayla guesses Kiska is leaving. When Kiska mentions seeing Agayla (when she was in the warren), Agayla says it was just a dream/vision. Kiska says goodbye and as she heads to her mother’s, wonders how Agayla knew the name “Artan.”</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Temper heads up to his post on the Hold, passing Lubben on his way. He hears that Larkin (the barracks bully) is under arrest for refusing to stand his post last night. He arrives at his post and pretends to Chase that he has no idea what happened last night as he was too drunk. Chase tells him there was an assassination attempt on an imperial official but that somehow the garrison didn’t hear a sound and the night watch saw/heard nothing. Chase takes off. Temper muses on how he’s proud he still had “what it took” and more importantly, found something left “worth fighting for.” He looks forward to seeing Corinn and hopes she won’t be leaving, especially as Temper will be spending a “long while to come” at the Hanged Man. He sees Tayschrenn’s cutter heading out.</p><p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Edgewalker finds Kellanved and Cotillion in Shadow. Kellanved reshapes shadow (Edgewalker thinks how they can “create whatever they wished from the raw stuff at their disposal”) into a keep. He then proposes a walk around the realm with Edgewalker as guide. Edgewalker says he doesn’t take Kellanved’s orders and when Kellanved threatens to set the Hounds on him Edgewalker says they would not attack him as they are “all kin. Slaves to Shadow.” Kellanved says he understands and that while Edgewalker is slave to Shadow, Kellanved “commands” Shadow. Edgewalker says nothing in reply to that. Kellanved and Cotillion disappear. Edgewalker leaves wondering why none of the claimants to the Shadowthrone ever learn or wonder why the throne is often so empty, though he also looks forward to the change and possible “progression” this new claimant might bring to the realm.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>A young boy and girl find a scaled man of some sort wedged into rocks and half-buried in sand at the beach. The creature grabs the boy then lets go. Later, the children lead their grandfather to the place. They stay back while he looks, then he comes out and tells them it was gone, though the girl sees something odd in her grandfather’s eyes. As they leave, the old man thinks of how he had killed the creature and how before he had done so it had spoken to him in Korelan and asked him four times “why are you killing us?” And the old man recalled his surprise that the creature’s blood had been warm and red.</p><p><strong>Prologue</strong><br/>Setting: Utna during the 9th year of Laseen’s reign as Empress.</p><p>SCENE 1<br/>A priest of Hood, covered with flies as part of a ritual, heads toward a line of shackled prisoners, most of them nobles culled by Laseen as examples. In the line are Felisin, sister to Paran as well as to the new Adjunct Tavore; Heboric Light Touch, a handless defrocked priest of Fener arrested for his “revised history”; and Baudin, a crude ferocious killer. Hood’s priest tells Fener he has a secret to show him, then the flies disappear and there is no priest under them. Tavore appears with her personal aide T’amber and sees Felisin but makes no sign beyond simple recognition. Felisin thinks how Tavore, to show her loyalty and make up for Paran’s seeming treachery, chose between Felisin and their mother for the slave ships, though their mother died anyway, soon after their father.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>The line of prisoners is “escorted” to the ships, but the crowd is allowed to vent their anger on the nobles with little fear of the guards and the march becomes a gruesome killing parade, with fewer than a third of the prisoners surviving. Felisin is kept alive by Heboric holding her up and pushing her forward while Baudin killed or maimed everyone he comes in contact with. At the end, he tosses the crowd the decapitated head of a noblewoman so they may pass. The guards finally intervene and escort the survivors to the ships.</p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Setting: Seven Cities continent, the desert of Raraku, roughly one year later.</p><p>Mappo Runt and Icarium watch from a distance as an Aptorian demon, sent by Shadowthrone but now controlled by Sha’ik, moves in the desert where somewhere Sha-ik’s army in encamped near a waterhole. They speculate it had been sent as a scout by Shadowthrone due to an oncoming convergence and decide to track it out of curiosity.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Mappo and Icarium rest in some ruins in the Holy Desert Marks on one of the columns informs them that a D’ivers in rat form (Gryllen, Mappo guesses) is “on the trail,” of the convergence, which involves “gates opening” and ascension. They guess many other shapeshifters, both D’ivers and Soletaken, are as well. Mappo asks Icarium what he will do if the gates do open (musing to himself that answers can be a curse) and Icarium says he hopes he’ll learn who he is, why he’s been alive for centuries but has no memories of his life. A Soletaken in wolf form appears (Ryllandaras, brother of Treach, whom Mappo says thinks he killed Ryllandaras when he was in jackal form), but when it realizes it is Mappo and Icarium it is clearly afraid. It goes after the aptorian demon.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Setting: HIssar, City on east coast of Seven Cities</p><p>A group of Wickan horsemen is disembarking. Watching are Duiker, Imperial Historian and Mallick Rel, advisor to the High Fist Pormqual and a Jhistal priest of Mael (Elder god of the sea) who has risen to his current position over a lot of conveniently dead bodies. Duiker says he’s interested in the tradition of shipping prisoner mages to mine Otataral on Otataral Island (they usually go mad) and that some mages are in the next shipment of slaves. The 7th squad’s lone surviving cadre mage, Kulp, appears with an unnamed captain. Duiker explains that the new Fist, Coltaine, led a Wickan uprising against the Empire and that Kellanved somehow obtained his loyalty. Laseen dumped him in some backwater but now that Seven Cities seems about to rebel, he’s been named Fist and sent here. When trouble seems ready to erupt between the Wickans and the Hissar guards, Coltaine steps in and stops it cold.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Setting: The Kansu Sea, off Seven Cities coast</p><p>Fiddler, Kalam, Crokus, and Apsala (with Moby, Mammot’s familiar) are sailing to the coast, where they plan to cross overland. Their boat is attacked by a Soletaken dhenrabi who says they had the misfortune of witnessing its passage. Fiddler blows it up with a crossbow munition. Crokus asks if it’s true Fiddler’s squad tracked Quick Ben through the desert w/ Kalam as the guide but that Kalam and Quick Ben had actually been setting a trap, though Whiskeyjack had figured it out. Crokus demands to know what they’re doing and Fiddler and Kalam tell Apsalar and Crokus that Kalam is going to try and kill Laseen.</p><p><strong>Chapter Two</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Setting: Hissar on southeast coast of Seven Cities.<br/>Duiker walks the streets of Hissar, noting the pictographs on the walls promising rebellion, signs the Malazan high command seems to have little interest in understanding. He ducks into a trader’s tent, pretending to be a Seven Cities native and opposed to the Malazans. There he witnesses a prophecy that the whirlwind (rebellion) will rise and that</p><blockquote><p>“Two fountains of raging blood! Face to face. The blood is the same, the two are the same and salty waves shall wash the shores of Raraku. the Holy Desert remembers its past. Leaving, Duikers muses on how ancient a land/civilization Seven Cities is, how cities lie beneath cities lie beneath cities and it is an enemy “we can never defeat . . . Perhaps victory is not achieved by overcoming that enemy, but by joining it, becoming one with it.”</p></blockquote><p>Inside the Imperial Hold, Duiker enters the council meeting attended by Coltaine, his lieutenant Bult, the cadre mage Kulp, and Mallick Rel. Coltaine recalls last seeing Duiker on his near-deathbed, after Bult had almost killed him in battle (Bult turned his lance when he saw Duiker unarmed). Bult himself had been wounded by Dujek, who lost his arm to Bult’s horse. Duiker says he had been unarmed as an historian but he now records the battles from a relatively safe distance in armor and with bodyguards.</p><p>Coltaine announces they are waiting for his warlock, which shocks the attendees as Laseen had purged the Wickan warlocks in a mass execution. Coltaine tells them that the crows came to the dead warlocks and took their souls back to the people to be reincarnated, including the greatest warlock’s—Sormo E’nath, whose power was so great it took eleven crows to carry it away where it was reincarnated. Coltaine introduces a roughly ten-year-old boy as Sormo. Duiker recalls the Rhivi have similar beliefs. Sormo witnessed the same divination in the trader’s camp as Duiker and both agree it promises rebellion soon. Rel tells Coltaine to treat such warning cautiously and skeptically. Sormo accuses Rel of having “hidden motives.” Rel then conveys High Fist’s Pormqual’s orders that Coltaine march overland to Aran to present the 7th Army, order Coltaine rejects, as it would leave the eastern seaboard empty of a Malazan presence. He tells Rel to tell Pormqual he advises a change of orders and will await a reply. Rel leaves upset at being insulted. Duiker reveals to Coltaine that Pormqual doesn’t really govern, Rel does, and that lots of people in Rel’s way end up dead or disappeared. Bult wonders if perhaps they weren’t murdered by Rel or Laseen, as thought, but chose to disappear themselves, and that perhaps Laseen now feels lonely and abandoned. Duiker replies maybe she should have thought of that before killing Kellanved and Dancer and Bult answers that maybe she did so because she knew that though they were good conquerors, they’d be terrible rulers. Coltaine asks Duiker to spy on Rel for him but reconsiders when Duiker worries he’ll be killed; instead Coltaine takes Duiker onto his staff. When the meeting breaks up, Duiker and Kulp speak alone. Kulp tells Duiker he senses the young Wickan boy really is Sormo. Duiker then asks Kulp to help free Heboric Light-Touch from enslavement on Otataral Island.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Setting: The Holy City of Ehrlitan on northeast coast of Seven Cities.<br/>Fiddler, in disguise as a Gral tribesman, has just witnessed a bloody attack by the Red Swords (a brutal Seven Cities military group loyal to the Empress) on believers of the Apocalypse (Dryjhana), including women and children. He saves two young girls whose adult companion was killed from being raped by a pimp by buying them off of them and returning them to their home. Their grandfather is Kimloc, the greatest Tano Spiritwalker (Spiritwalkers have great magic and use song to express it). In conversation, Kimloc warns Fiddler that the desert they plan on crossing to get a ship in Aran will be dangerous due to the Path of Hands, a warren/gate that will soon open and perhaps allow one of the many D’ivers or Soletaken shapeshifters converging there to Ascend and gain power over his/her kind. He also says he knows of the Bridgeburners’ past, how they were “honed in the heat and scorched rock of the Holy Desert Raraku, in pursuit of a Falah’d company of wizards.” He asks permission to take Fiddler’s history with a simple touch so he might fashion that story into a song of power, hinting at the possibility that such a song might lead the Bridgeburners to ascend. Fiddler says no, fearful of what is in his head that might be dangerous to Kimloc and too revelatory of Fiddler. Kimloc gives Fiddler a conch shell invested with songs of power to protect him in the desert. Departing, Fiddler and Kimloc’s captain discuss the decision by Kimloc to cede the Holy City of Karakarang peacefully to the Empire, though he had claimed he could destroy the Malazan armies. The captain says Kimloc had recognized that the Empire would use up as many lives as needed, and Fiddler says even Kimloc probably couldn’t have stopped the T’lan Imass, who had already killed the people of Aren. When the captain says that was a sign of the Empire’s madness, Fiddler argues it was a mistake and says “no command was ever given to the Logros T’lan Imass.”</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Fiddler returns to the others and tells Kalam of the convergence. Kalam agrees, saying he read it amid the signs promising rebellion. Fiddler holds back that he met Kimloc, knowing Kalam would kill Kimloc and his family.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Kalam heads to the old city right next to Ehrlitan. He meets Mebra and forces him to tell Kalam the signs/codes that will let him safely pass through the desert. Mebra seemingly accidentally drops the Holy Book of Dryjhana which must be brought to the Seeress so she can raise the Whirlwind. Kalam say she’ll take it to her as security of his safe passage. After Kalam leaves, it’s revealed that this was a Red Sword set up (though they didn’t know the agent of the rebellion would be Kalam) and that they are going to track the book to the Seeress in the desert. Mebra convinces them to let Kalam live afterward, guessing he is heading to Malaz to kill the Empress—important knowledge for the Empire.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Setting: the border between the Holy Desert and the Pan’poysun Odhan<br/>Icarium and Mappo have bested a D’ivers leopard pack (Icarium narrowly avoiding losing himself in anger) but Mappo is injured. They’ve stopped below a tower up in the cliffs but can see no way of getting there. While stopped, a Soletaken bear appears whom Mappo knows. Messremb sembles into human form and speaks pleasantly to both, saying he was curious at the strange scent accompanying Mappo. Curiosity sated, he’ll head back to seek the Path/gates. Mappo warns him they’d met Ryllandaras earlier. After Messremb leaves, Iskaral Pust, High Priest of Shadow, show sup on a mule, talking to himself and disjointedly, repeating “a live given for a life taken.” He says he’ll take them into the tower, which he took over after the nuns of the Queen of Dreams had abandoned it. He sends the mule into the cave, out of it comes Servant (later Icarium and Mappo discuss that a warren had opened in the cave), who climbs up a rope dropped by a bhok’aral and then the three others are pulled up. Icarium has forgotten their recent fight and Mappo lies, saying he fought a single leopard alone and had just used Icarium’s weapon, which is why it has blood on it.</p><p><strong>Chapter Three</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Setting: Skullcap, the Otataral mine pit on Otataral Island, off east coast of Seven Cities.<br/>Felisin has just slept with Beneth (a mine overseer though a slave himself) to ensure a day of rest for Heboric, continuing the pattern that had started on the slave ship of selling her body for favors to make survival more likely. It appears that Captain Sawark, in charge of the mine, has received orders to make sure Heboric dies in the mine. Beneth agrees to give him an easier job. Felisin remembers Heboric’s musings on Otataral theories: how it forms only in limestone, that it doesn’t appear natural but is formed magically, how the island’s Otataral seems to have happened when the whole island “melted” when the magic got out of control. Beneth and Felisin come across a young guard Pella, who is worried about the island’s Malazans being outnumbered by the Dosii, with all the talk of rebellion. Beneth tells him not to worry. Pella quotes Kellanved to him, via Duiker’s history, and tells both that the historian’s works are “worth learning.” As they pass Sinker Lake (one of the boundaries of the pit), Felisin notes how much it has dropped as Heboric had asked, though she thinks it useless—everyone who has ever tried escape has either died in the surrounding desert (nearly all) or been caught and executed. Beneth asks Felisin to move in with him but she rejects it, distracting him instead with an offer of a threesome with her and Bula (innkeep), thinking she just needs to keep alive for the day she can face Tavore and kill her.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Felisin enters the tent she shares with Baudin and Heboric. She and Heboric argue, he angry and bitter and guilt-ridden over what she’s done to protect him, she angry over what she’s been forced to do as well as her feeling excluded from some plan the two of them seem to have and her sense that she’s completely on her own. Heboric is also concerned about her growing use of durhang (a drug) and wine.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Setting: Hissar<br/>Duiker watches as Admiral Nok and the fleet depart, taking Rel with them. Kulp arrives and tells him arrangements have been made with regard to helping Heboric escape. They watch as a transport arrives with Red Blades, who have been sent to pacify a restless population if needed. Instead, they disembark ready to immediately attack the market, though they are delayed by Coltaine’s Wickan who had been in the market in disguise. Kulp intervenes with the two brothers (Mesker and Baria) that lead the Red Blades. The Hissar Guards appear with Wickan archers and the brothers back down. Kulp tells Duiker that Coltaine has completely changed the drills; rather than practice battlefield techniques, he has them practicing urban battles involving refugees. Duiker, recognizing what Coltaine fears is coming, tells Kulp to push the Seventh.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Coltaine, Bult, and Duiker are watching the next drill. The Seventh is doing better and Coltaine leaves to give them Wickan Lancer support. Duiker tells Bult the Seventh has earned a day of rest. When Bult at first seems skeptical, Duiker tells him Coltaine will need them rested for what is to come. Bult agrees.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Setting: Ehrlitan<br/>Fiddler and Kalam have had an argument over Kalam taking the book to Sha’ik—Kalam wanting to wound Laseen as much as possible and Fiddler concerned over the Empire and Laseen’s successor. He tells Crokus how things are allegiances are getting confusion: Kalam to Seven Cities, Malazans to the Empire (as opposed to the Empress), etc. While Kalam finds Sha’ik, Fiddler tells Crokus their group will find another “road to Unta,” one that’s “probably never been used before and may not even work.” Crokus scoffs at Fiddler’s chances if Kalam doesn’t make. Moby (identified by Fiddler as a bhok’aral and native to Seven Cities) appears and Fiddler tells Crokus they’ll find more supporters than he Crokus thinks and nobody should be dismissed as useless. Crokus has figured out that Kalam and Fiddler have thought of Apsalar as a backup and that he won’t allow it. Fiddler says she retains Dancer’s skills though the possession is over and that Crokus doesn’t get to speak for her.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Fiddler, Crokus, and Apsalar prepare to leave, with Fiddler in Gral disguise as guardian and guide to two newlyweds making pilgrimage. A group of Red Blades ask Fiddler if they’ve seen a man on a roan riding out; Fiddler says no. Crokus is worried whomever Kalam met the night before has betrayed him. As they ride out, Crokus tells Fiddler Moby has disappeared. Crokus is confused and upset over why his uncle didn’t do anything with his power.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Setting: Iskaral Pust’s temple<br/>Pust tells Mappo to kill any spiders he sees. Mappo has been healed by Pust/Servant, though he won’t completely accept it until two moon cycles has passed and with them the danger of the lycanthropy that a Soletaken/D’iver’s woundings can cause. Mappo goes to join Icarium in Pust’s library, which he’s populated with books he’s stolen from the “great library of the world.”</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Icarium is fascinated by the books he’s found and what seems to be evidence of a rich ancient civilization. Mappo recognizes the writing as that of the Nameless Ones. Mappo, seeking to distract Icarium, argues that the books are a sign of decline in that culture, showing an “indolence characterized by pursuit of knowledge . . . no matter the value of such answers,” and gives Gothos’s Folly as an example, saying Gothos’ awareness “of everything, every permutation, every potential” was “Enough to poison every scan he cast on the world.” Icarium believes the books are evidence of his theory that the ruins in Raraku are of a great civilization, perhaps the first human one. Mappo, worried about this trend of thought, asks what it matters. Icarium talks about his obsession with time and says in the end he was just passing time. Mappo changes the subject to his distrust of Pust and desire to leave. Icarium says he suspects that his goal will be achieved in this place and so he prefers to not leave. Mappo then flashes back to his encounter with the Nameless Ones and their statement that they think “not in years, but in centuries.”</p><p><strong>Chapter Four</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Setting: Otataral Mine</p><p>Felisin, numbed by durhang and her experiences, watches as Beneth’s men futilely try to rescue miners buried in a collapse. Heboric is no longer in the mines but is working a better job thanks to her. She thinks of how she’s going to Beneth more and more, “wanting to be used.” Heboric tells her she does it to feel anything, even pain. Pella comes up and asks if she relayed his message to Heboric; she doesn’t remember him.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Felisin accompanies Beneth to a meeting with Captain Sawark. Beneth warns Sawark about the Dosii in camp and the rebellion. Sawark dismisses it. Beneth wonders if Sawark has found “the name you sought.” Sawark denies looking for anyone. Beneth offers Felisin to him for knowledge of why Baudin was arrested that morning. Beneth mentions Felisin’s age and arrival date and Sawark goes pale, then asks Beneth if Baudin works for him. Upon exiting the meeting, Beneth beats Felisin, demanding to know who she really is and why Sawark reacted to her as he did. Felisin says she was a foundling left to a Fener Monastery on Malaz Island. Beneth beats her unconscious and leaves her. She awakens in her tent with Heboric ministering to her. She tells him to tell Beneth she’s sorry and wants to go back to him. He says he covered for her so Beneth might take her back.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Setting: Estara hills coastal road/Ladro Keep</p><p>Kalam is driven to seek shelter from a sandstorm at a Malazan guardhouse. Harassed by the company there, he reveals himself as a Clawmaster to the sergeant in charge. Lostara Yil and a fellow Red Blade arrive (in disguise). A merchant’s wife begins to do a Deck “reading” but Kalam calls her out as a fraud. In anger she throws the Deck at him and it forms a pattern around him: Six cards of High House Death surrounding a single card—the Rope, Assassin of Shadow.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Lostara and her company are the last to leave the keep, after killing the soldiers inside. They continue to tail Kalam.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Setting: Pust’s temple</p><p>Exploring the temple, Icarium and Mappo find a stair leading down to an older structure and a room with paintings of beasts on the walls and a blocked doorway. They free the portal and find a corridor that has the sense of Kurald Galain (Tiste Andii warren), according to Icarium: “the feel of Dark” or an Elder Warren and one he cannot name. The corridor leads to a room filled with sorcery that has been corrupted, it has the feel of D’ivers/Soletaken and they realize they’ve found the Path of Hands, the Gate. Icarium and Mappo both recognize the carvings as familiar, and Icarium says they’re getting closer to comprehension, which worries Mappo. They decide to ask Pust. Pust tells them “nothing is as it seems.” Wonders why the two of them, despite their age, haven’t ascended. He tells a story of his staring contest with a bhok’aral and mentions that one who “does not waver from his cause” is “dull-witted.” When questioned by Mappo Pust says they know nothing of Shadowthrone’s plans and tells them to find his broom. Icarium, to Mappo’s surprise, agrees to.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Setting: Hissar/desert outside of Hissar</p><p>Duiker, Kulp, Bult, and Sormo ride out to an old oasis so Sormo can perform a rite. Duiker is uneasy over it. Sormo says the spirits he wants to contact are pre-Seven-Cities, akin to the Tellann Warren, which only makes Duiker more nervous. He mentions the T’lan Imass have “turned their backs on the Empress” since the Emperor’s assassination and when Sormo asks if he’s never wondered why that was, Duiker thinks he has a theory but it would be treason to voice it. When Sormo performs his rite, they enter the Tellann warren and are immediately attacked by Shapeshifters and Bult goes down, stung by many wasps. A huge black demon comes out of nowhere to aid them against the many D’ivers/Soletaken. Kulp knocks out Sormo with a punch and they return to the oasis. Sormo says there are only 10 crows left, then tells them they walked into a convergence by coincidence; that the Shapeshifters were using the warren assuming no Imass would be in order to get to the Path of Hands or there is some link between Tellann and shapeshifting. Kulp works on healing Bult.</p><p><strong>Chapter Five</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Setting: City of G’dansiban</p><p>Fiddler, Crokus, and Apsalar find G’dansiban surrounded by a rebel army. They are barred by a guard unit but Fiddler’s horse brutally bites the face of one of the guards. A group of passing Arak warriors are amused by this and Fiddler manages to get them invited to the Arak camp. The Araks tell Fiddler the city will be “cleansed,” the Malazan merchants and nobles executed. Crokus and Apsalar worry about their disguise not lasting the night and then Apsalar, channeling Dancer’s instincts, says they need to get out of there. The Araks tell them a Gral clan is coming (which would blow the disguise) so Fiddler concocts a story as to why the Gral will go after him and why they thus have to press on through the city.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>In the city they find death and destruction. They save a young girl from being raped by killing the six men after her. Crokus and Apsalar ride on while Fiddler faces down a Red Blades squad that comes into the square. The come across another scene of a massacre and Crokus asks if the Malazans did the same in conquest. Apsalar (again channeling Dancer’s memories) retorts the Emperor waged war against armies, not civilians, and when Fiddler mentions the massacre at Aren Apsalar angrily says Kellanved didn’t give that order; Surly/Laseen did and that Apsalar/Dancer was sent there to see what happened and argued with Surly/Laseen. Fiddler realizes Kellanved and Dancer ascended at their “assassination” to become Shadowthrone and Cotillion and curses himself for not putting it together with the names and the appearance of a new House (Shadow) right after their deaths. He angrily asks why Dancer didn’t tell anyone, they were his friends, and Apsalar says Dancer trusted only two people (Kellanved and Dassem) and that Cotillion trusts nobody, including Shadowthrone. They ride out of the south gate and are joined by Moby, wounded as if he’s been in a fight, though Fiddler says it’s probably from mating. They look back and see Grals in pursuit.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Kalam is taken by Sha’ik’s bodyguards: Leoman, Captain of her bodyguards; and an unnamed Toblakai (7 feet tall with a wooden sword). They accept he’s carrying the Holy Book and Sha’ik herself appears and Kalam gives it to her. She offers him a place with her army/rebellion, but when he says he has another destiny she says she senses what his desire is and not only allows him to go but sends an aptorian demon (the one Mappo and Icarium saw earlier) as an escort. Kalam leaves, with the escort, thinking how strange it is that he started the rebellion against the Empire and is now going to kill Laseen to preserve the Empire so it can put down the rebellion and he wonders how many deaths he’s caused.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>At dawn, just as Sha’ik opens the book she is killed by Lostara Yill’s crossbow bolt. The Red Blades attack Leoman and Toblakai, but are driven off. Tene Baralta orders Lostara to keep tailing Kalam.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Leoman and Toblakai decide to wait with Sha’ik’s body, based on the prophecy that said she would be “renewed.” Toblakai says there’s a storm coming.</p><p><strong>Chapter Six</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Setting: Otataral mine<br/>Baudin has been missing for six days now while Sawark searches for him. Felisin is back with Beneth, mostly because he doesn’t trust her anymore due to her connection with Baudin and Sawark’s reaction to her. Heboric has warned her Beneth knows more now from Sawark about her and he wants to destroy her. Beneth questions her as to if it’s his fault what she’s become (“you could have said no”) and she says no, “the faults are all mine.” As they walk outside, Beneth is attacked by a group of Dosii, thus beginning the rebellion in the mining area. Felisin flees and is found by Pella, who takes her back to her tent where Heboric and Baudin are preparing an escape, though he’s unsure if they still want her. Heboric asks if Pella wants to come but he says he has to rejoin his squad. They tell Felisin they’ll swim to the caves under Sinker Lake and she refuses to go without Beneth, saying they owe her and him. Baudin agrees to get him.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>As Heboric and Felisin wait in marshes near the lake, Heboric tells her the escape has been planned by Duiker, that they’ll cross the desert to get picked up by boat. They are attacked by bloodflies, though Fener’s gift keeps Heboric untouched. Felisin, though, has been bitten and the bites leave egg sacs which will hatch larvae that will eat her from the inside out, killing her. Heboric has a salve to drive them out, but Felisin is left disfigured/pockmarked. Sawark finds them and leaves them, telling Heboric it isn’t for him but for Felisin’s sake. Baudin arrives and tells them Beneth is dead; Felisin doesn’t believe he even looked for him. They escape via the lake and caves. Baudin returns from scouting and tells them the nearby city is the site of a fierce mage battle and that Seven Cities has risen in rebellion.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Setting: A coastal city<br/>Duiker and Kulp are trying to purchase a boat or hire someone to take them to the rendezvous with the escapees. In the local inn, they meet a Malazan guard troop, led by Corporal Gesler and including Stormy, and Truth. The inn comes under attack and the two groups join together to try and reach a ship the guardsmen have outfitted at the dock. They get separated by the attack; Kulp goes after the enemy High Mage, Duiker ends up with Stormy. They see flames over Hissar and Duiker decides to skip the ship and get to his horse so he can ride to rejoin Coltaine. The others make the ship and Kulp sneaks them away while the enemy mage seeks them out. Kulp pulls rank and tries to order Gesler’s group to the rendezvous and when they ask why they don’t just throw him overboard, he tells them he needs to pick up a High Priest of Fener and tossing him overboard might anger the god. Laughing, the men reveal they are part of an outlawed cult of Fener and they head for the rendezvous.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Setting: Hissar<br/>Duiker takes on the same Dosii disguise we saw him use in the trader camp earlier. He passes Malazans on “sliding beds”—slow killing devices. He rides to Hissar and finds the city attacked, the compound empty, but evidence implies the Seventh had held up and, though unable to save an attack on the Malazan city area, had ambushed the attackers and taken a host of refugees out of the city. He rides with a group of attackers aiming to catch up to the rebel commanders. Kamist Reloe (though killed by Sha’ik in a fight over who would lead the Apocalypse), who plans on harassing Coltaine and his 10,000 refugees, about to be 20,000 as they move toward Sialk, another city conquered by the rebels. Reloe plans on a final battle in three days. Duiker thinks Reloe might be overconfident.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>Setting: Pust’s temple<br/>Exploring further (looking for Pust’s broom), Mappo and Icarium find a fishing boat in one of the temple rooms and deduce it must belong to Servant (him and his boat swept up by Shadow and brought here for some purpose). They decide to ask Pust about it.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Mappo and Icarium confront Pust as he’s reading the Deck and he calls them ignorant. He pulls lots of cards, reads “renewal, a resurrection without passage through Hood’s gate,” and tells them they need to go on another journey. Icarium loses patience with Pust and begins to choke him. Pust tells them they must go to Raraku because Sha’ik is dead.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Icarium suggests the resurrection Pust spoke of might be Sha’ik, based on the prophecies. Mappo doesn’t want to get involved, happy the “witch is dead,” especially if it stops the rebellion. He says he doesn’t want to be a tool of the gods or their servant, as most of them, “especially those most eager to meddle in mortal affairs,” feed off of “blood and chaos.” Icarium agrees, but wishes to see the resurrection, wondering how it will bypass Hood who always seems to “ensure he wins in [any] exchange.” Mappo tells Icarium he worries of what is waking in Raraku (and thinks to himself he fears it then awakening Icarium). Icarium say he will go anyway and asks if Mappo will come; Mappo says yes.</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>Setting: The desert<br/>Fiddler, Crokus, and Apsalar are pursed by the Grals into the whirlwind. The wind has uncovered an ancient road and bones. Fiddler thinks it may lead to Tremorlor, the “legendary gate” and the Azath House Quick Ben told them is there. The Gral catch up and Fiddler kills them with a cusser. As they continue in the Whirlwind, Fiddler thinks the goddess behind it is mad and wonders who can stop her.</p><p>SCENE 9<br/>Setting: Another part of the desert<br/>Kalam travels with the aptorian demon, which he’s tried to lose unsuccessfully due to mistrusting it. They’re attacked by a wolf D’ivers (one the demon fought before). They fight it off, though the demon is wounded.</p><p><strong>Chapter Seven</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Duiker, with a rebel sergeant, looks on the aftermath of a Kamist Reloe’s attack on Coltaine, which Roe lost. Pretending he’s going to search for his “nephew’s” body among the corpses, he rids himself of the sergeant and the squad. As he rides on, he thinks of Coltaine’s narrowed options, as well as his own small chances of surviving his attempt to catch up with and join Coltaine.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Felisin and Baudin wait for Heboric to rejoin them after he’s gone to look at hundreds of thousands of beetles that emerged from the desert floor at dusk. She thinks how Heboric might be a liability with his lack of focus. She is less swollen due to the bloodfly poison, but feels it has “laid a stain on her soul.” Every night now she dreams of a river of blood and she begins to look forward to the promise of the dream. Heboric returns to say the beetles will pose no obstacle as they heading west to the sea. They have enough food to reach their rendezvous but the margin is small and they aren’t going as fast as planned. At the end of a day’s march, they come across an impossibly tall finger sticking out of the sand, impossibly tall not only in itself but in what it promises lies beneath the sand. Heboric touches the jade carved finger with one of his stumps.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>Felisin notes that Heboric is favoring the stump he touched the statue with last night. An Otataral storm arises and they enter their tents for cover, though Felisin sees no need to. Baudin hints he may have killed Beneth but Felisin doesn’t believe him. When Felisin lies down she calls up the river, feeling it is protective and offers her a purpose and destiny, that she will become more than she is.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>The next morning, in bad moods, they fight and Felisin asks why Heboric lost his hands. He refuses to answer. They see his stump is swollen and infected-looking, the tattoos at his wrist have turned solid dark. He says it hurts a lot and he wonders how the statue’s magic survives in Otataral sand, or if the Otataral gave birth to its magic. When they camp that night Heboric is way behind. Baudin goes after him and Felisin, suspicious he is hoarding water due to his seemingly impossible fitness, rifles his stuff. She discovers assassin’s tools and a talon. Baudin returns with Heboric and gives him water over Felisin’s objections. She holds her sacrifice over his head and Baudin says most of their favors came from what he did for the guards in the mining prison, not her sacrifices, and that Beneth used to laugh at her “noble cause.” Felisin thinks he’s just trying to poison her thoughts of Beneth as well as escape his own guilt over what she did to keep them safe. She tells them of her dream and says she’ll be the only survivor.</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>The next oasis is fouled by capemoth larvae. Desperate as they now stand no chance, Baudin tries to wake Heboric’s god Fener (Heboric is unconscious). Felisin tells Baudin there was a tattoo on Heboric’s right hand that held to the sacred mark on his chest would do it and w/out his hands he can no longer call on his god. Baudin touches his stump to the mark and the air “screams,” Heboric’s tattoos “blossom out” onto the stone, and an immense hoof hits the ground then rises up again as Fener is called down. Heboric wakes and says “he’s here . . . in the mortal realm.” Felisin says “don’t mess with mortals.” Heboric is rejuvenated and the head out to the next water-hole.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Setting: Mappo and Icarium in the desert having left Pust’s temple<br/>Mappo flashes back 200 years ago, when he was already several centuries old, to when he returned to his home town and found it destroyed a month past, its 15,000 inhabitants slain. He had returned after the diviners in his adopted clan had “seen” the destruction, destruction that had been predicted by the Nameless Ones months earlier. The Nameless Ones told them to forsake vengeance and choose one to take on the task of ensuring such a disaster would never happen again. The Nameless One he spoke to told him, “One day he [Icarium] shall return to his home . . . until that time you must attend.” Mappo is plucked out of his memory by Icarium’s voice mentioning how strange a “land untraveled can look so familiar” and then he mentions how he is fascinated by Mappo’s memories (as Icarium has none), though Mappo rarely shares them. The two watch the sandstorm and note it has both grown and traveled nearer and wonder if Sha’ik has Ascended. Mappo once again bridles at being manipulated by Pust and Icarium says he’s used to it. When Mappo asks who is manipulating him, Icarium shrugs and says he stopped asking that a long time ago. As Icarium turns his back to prepare food, Mappo goes back to thinking about “sweet vengeance.”</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>Setting: The desert road with Fidder et. al. nearby where Mappo and Icarium were<br/>As they travel down the road, Fiddler and the others can hear a running battled nearby, hidden in the sandstorm. The battle sounds are not human but bestial and demon: bears, cat, reptiles, etc. Crokus’ horse goes down and they stop. They can start to see some of the combatants now—Soletaken and D’ivers. A trio of Gral hunters appear down the road behind them but are attacked by a massive bear, which kills one while Apsalar kills the other two, then a fourth Fiddler hadn’t seen. Fiddler is unseated (gaining broken ribs in the process) by a huge tail. Something attacks him and is attacked in response by his horse. The battle ends. Crokus and Apsalar are okay, the bear remains, feeding on a Gral horse for a moment, then flees. Thousands of D’ivers rats appear and Fiddler tells Apasalar to get the last cusser for suicide. Just as she does though, a voice (Icarium) calls out the name of the D’ivers (Gryllen—Tide of Madness, “flushed out of Y’ghatan in the fire”) and tells it to leave. Fiddler is shocked Gryllen actually hesitates. Mappo steps out next to Icarium and Fiddler knows he should know these two—a Jhag and a Trell, but the pain is muddying his thinking. Icarium tells Gryllen the trio is under his protection and Gryllen retreats. Fiddler blacks out.</p><p><strong>Chapter Eight</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Duiker, still trying to catch up to Coltaine’s army and the refugees, finds that Coltaine has surprisingly attacked a larger army and slaughtered them, leading to exaggerated rumors that would work against the enemy, such as that the Wickans were demons or were helped by a Malazan ascendant. Duiker makes his way to the nearest oasis and finds that the refugees had been and gone, wrecking the oasis before heading out into the steppes (a move Duiker can’t fathom). Wondering how long Coltaine can hold off “the inevitable” Duiker continues to follow.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Having reached the coast, Felisin, Baudin, and Heboric make a meal of some crabs on the shore where they had hoped to rendezvous with their rescuers. Heboric, now totally black, is in a surprisingly good mood. When Heboric goes to bed, Felisin invites Baudin into her tent. After Baudin appears to fall asleep after sex, she tries to stab him but he was prepared the entire time for the attempt. She blames him for leaving Beneth to die and he tells her he killed him himself. Before leaving, he says he only had sex to see if she was “still what you were.” Felisin thinks he already knew she was but he wanted to show it to her.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Sorcery lights up the sky off the beach and Heboric stands between it and Felisin, while Baudin crouches next to her. The lightning seems to strike Heboric, making his tattoos flare, then it shatters and vanishes, due Heboric says not to him but the Otataral. A boat appears with sorcery attacking it. Four men leap out and one, a mage according to Heboric, says they need the group’s help.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Kulp and the others on the Ripath (Gesler, Stormy, etc.) have been running for days under the random attack of an insane mage trapped in a nightmare, driving them to the Otataral Island shore (Kulp thinks it’s an escaped prisoner driven mad by the Otataral). They’d been sailing along the coast for some time when Kulp had felt the Otataral presence “soften,” as if some power were weakening or negating Otataral’s effect. Having landed, he believes it has something to do with Heboric. As he looks at the group of three, Kulp is “alarmed” by something. He also immediately notes that Baudin is something more than just a thug and is also “disturbed” by Felisin for some reason. Looking at Heboric via his warren, Kulp sees a “ghost hand” of power continuing on from his left stump; it looked like it was reaching into a warren and holding something tight. His right stump had a different kind of power—a mix of Otataral red and some unknown green, which was blunting the effect of the Otataral. He sees it as a “battle of warrens”—the ghost hand Fener’s warren, the other hand a mix of Otataral and a warren Kulp has never seen before. Kulp fills them in on what he knows. Heboric tells him he believes Coltaine lives. Felisin tells them (they’re a Fener cult remember) that Heboric is an excommunicated priest and the “bane of his own god.” Kulp and Heboric go away from the others; Kulp asks if the other two can be trusted. Heboric says Baudin can be trusted so long at their interests are shared and that Felisin cannot be. Later, when Gesler asks Kulp how they’ll get off the island with the insane mage still out there, Kulp says Heboric will deal with it.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Felisin looks at the newcomers with “disdain,” worshipping a god torn down to ground and vulnerable. She asks Baudin about the talon she found in his gear and Heboric, overhearing, tells Baudin “well done,” but refuses to explain to Felisin. Baudin, meanwhile, doesn’t seem to agree with Heboric’s assessment of him. Felisin, angered, dreams of the rebellion succeeding and taking the entire Empire down with it: “an end to repression, an end to the threat of restraint as I set about exacting revenge.” She decides to try and get the newcomers on her side via her usual method. After some great humor, Gesler tells her to take off, that they see through her. Spitefully, she tells them Heboric will betray them and that he despises them. She goes into the water herself, exhausted, and thinks how she can’t do anything but lash out and that there must be some way to “reflect something other than hate and contempt . . . a reason.”</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>The next day Kulp says he hopes the Otataral in Heboric will keep the insane mage at bay. He notes his warren, Maenas, feels different, more “eager” and less “remote” than usual. They enter the water and the ship is attacked by sorcery again in the form of “spears,” one of which pierces Stormy’s thigh. Heboric covers Felisin. When the sorcery stops, they are in the mage’s warren and Kulp looks up to see a tiny figure riding the storm high above, blood spraying around it. Heboric uses his Fener ghost hand to heal Stormy’s thigh, though Kulp had seen some taint pass through. Baudin had also been injured (his hand) but refused Heboric’s healing. A strange pale blue thick water is slowly filling the ship’s hold, but they’re only fifty yards or so from a large, seemingly abandoned ship, which Baudin identifies as a “Quon dromon, Pre-Imperial.” They swim over to the Silanda, which Baudin has identified because it had been the only ship allowed to trade with the Tiste Andii and it had gone missing years ago. When they open up one of the on-deck bundles, they find a severed Tiste Andii head inside, which is the case for the dozens of other bundles.</p><p>Below decks, Kulp and Gesler find the oars manned by headless bodies. Kulp says someone killed everyone, beheaded them, then set them to work as rowers. In the captain’s cabin they find four more bodies, non-Tiste Andii. Three of them are crushed. The fourth is in the captain’s chair impaled by a spear. His is the only corpse with blood, and it still looks wet. Kulp guesses these four killed the Tiste Andii, sailed into the warren (possibly accidentally), then were killed by someone else. While Gesler goes to get Heboric, Kulp studies the maps in the room and recognizes very little. Heboric thinks they are Tiste Edur, referenced in Gothos’s Folly as one of three Tiste groups from another realm, the Edur from the “unwelcome union of Mother Dark with the Light.” He explains the Tiste Andii considered it a “degradation of pure Dark, and the source of all their subsequent ills.” He also says the spear is a Barghast weapon, though oddly large. Kulp takes the rowers’ whistle from the captain’s neck. Out on deck, Kulp feels the whistle’s sorcery and realizes the cabin had Otataral in it. Up in the crow’s nest, Truth sees a sorcery storm approaching (the insane mage). Gesler blows the whistle and the oarsmen begin. The eyes in the severed heads also open. Felisin looks at Truth and envies his innocence, thinks she walled off all that was vulnerable in herself.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Fiddler wakes in Pust’s temple with Pust and Mappo there. After Mappo leaves, Pust says he knows Fiddler’s goal is Tremorlor, asks if Fiddler knows “The Chain of Dogs,” which he says has already begun, then utters “shadow-borne prophecies . . . The gutter under the flood. A river of blood, the flow of words from a hidden heart. All things sundered. Spiders in every crook and corner.” Mappo tells Fiddler to pay attention to everything Pust says, then, after admitting he follows Icarium to keep his search endless, says he and Icarium will join them to find Tremorlor. He also tells Fiddler that Pust saved Fiddler’s life and rebuilt his shattered ankle. Crokus bursts in worried that Apsalar will be re-possessed because they are in a temple of Shadow. Prompted by Icarium, Pust reassures them by explaining Cotillion won’t repossess her due to Rake’s threat (from GoTM), Cotillion no longer see her as valuable, and that his residue of skills in her is cause for concern (thought that last was possibly an accidental slip).</p><p>Fiddler then gives a mini-lecture on Tremorlor and the Azath houses. Says they are rumored to be on every continent, they are a lodestone to power, that Kellanved and Dancer occupied the Deadhouse in Malaz City. He continues with Quick Ben’s theory that all are linked via gates and one can use them for near-instantaneous travel and says they plan on using Tremorlor to get to Malaz City, a half-day’s sail from Apsalar’s home. Pust says at Tremorlor there will be blades and fangs; Icarium shall find his past, Apsalar what she doesn’t yet know she seeks, Crokus the cost of becoming a man (or not), Fiddler the Emperor’s blessing; and Mappo will do what he must. He then vanishes. When Fiddler asks if there is magic in words, Icarium says enough “to drive gods to their knees.”</p><p><strong>Chapter Nine</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>It is five days after the soletaken attack and Kalam is feeling tracked by someone. He comes across the scenes of an ambush with a trail of Malazan refugees leading away into hostile land. Apt finds the survivors’ trail but Kalam says it isn’t there problem. He runs into a band of bandits (using the rebellion as cover) who tell him the rebellion holds all the cities but Aren (“and Aren has the Jhistal within”) and only one Malaz army is left, burdened by refugees and led by a Wickan named Coltaine. The bandit leader threatens to take Kalam’s horse but pretends it a joke when Kalam doesn’t back down. Instead, he asks Kalam to join them when they attack the survivors from the ambush. Kalam agrees, but says they should join the army to attack Aren and leave the survivors to the desert. The leader says they will go to Aren’s “yawning gates” afterward. Apt, meanwhile, disappeared before the bandits saw the demon.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>The band splits and readies to attack. Kalam kills the bandit leader. Riding into the survivors’ camp, Kalam sees it’s a trap (the bedrolls have nobody in them). The survivors kill three of the bandits and Kalam kills the last. The survivors are Captain Keneb, his wife Selv, their two children, and her sister Minala. Before Keneb passes out from a head wound, Kalam convinces him to trust him (Keneb also recognizes Kalam’s name when he learns it). Kalam decides to attack the last bandit back at their camp for their supplies; the survivors go with him.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>When Kalam arrives at the bandit camp, the lone guard has been joined by another group of seven, who had brought women they had raped and killed. As Kalam looks on, Apt reappears. Kalam kills them all. Minala arrives and tells him there had been two others whom she’d found torn apart.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Keneb tells Kalam that the nearby rebellion army is commanded by Korbolo Dom, a former Fist of the Empire who married a local and turned traitor, executing half his legion who refused to go along. They took Orbal (Keneb’s city) by riding in as allies. Kalam knows Korbolo, who was Whiskeyjack’s replacement for a time after Raraku. Kalam recalls him as an excellent tactician but too bloodthirsty. Laseen seemed to agree and had him replaced by Dujek. Kalam takes charge as Keneb’s head wound makes him a bit suspect decision-wise. They ride out.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>A wave throws a knee-deep layer of silt on the Silanda. Heboric notes that the warren had been prairie and was recently flooded. Out of the silt form six T’lan Imass, Logros T’lan. Their bonecaster (Hentos Ilm) tells Kulp to stand aside (calling him “Servant of the Chained One”) because they have come for their kin and the Tiste Edur. Kulp tells them there are no T’lan Imass and the Edur are dead. While two Imass check, the bonecaster tells Heboric to call down his mage in the sky because his wound is spreading and must be stopped, and also tells him to tell Fener that the Imass will not allow the god to damage the warrens. Felisin laughs and tells Hentos she’s gotten nothing right so far. Heboric explains. The other Imass tell Hentos the Malazans were telling the truth and she tells them they were looking for “renegade kin.” Hentos tells Heboric she doesn’t recognize the strange power in his ghost hand but that if the insane mage isn’t dealt with, Heboric will lose his sanity to his Otataral power. She says they must kill the mage and seal the wound. When Kulp asks what warren they’re in, she informs him it is the elder warren Kurald Emurlahn. Kulp says he’s heard of Kurald Galain (the Tiste Andii warren) and she tells him Emurlahn is the Edur one, and that Kulp’s warren (Meanas) is the “child” of Emurlahn. Kulp says that doesn’t make sense as Meanas is the warren of Shadow, of Ammanas and Cotillion and her reply is Edur came before Shadowthrone and Cotillion.</p><p>Hentos touches Heboric and tells him he is “shorn” from Fener though Fener still makes use of him. Hentos goes into the sky (in dust form) and kills the mad mage and while the storm disappears what is left is a black “lesion” the size of a moon. Hentos says a soul must bridge the wound. One of the Imass, Legana Breed, volunteered as he is clanless. He gives Stormy his sword then goes up into the lesion. The wound closes in on itself. Before they disappear, one of the Imass, in answer to Stormy’s question, tells him that Legana will feel great pain forever, as the wound heals around him and he doesn’t die. Truth tells them that Legana took one of the Edur heads with him. (And he was pretty sure Hentos didn’t see him do it.) Felisin converses with Baudin, who tells her “You ever think that maybe what you are is what’s trapping you inside whatever it is you’re trapped inside?”</p><p><strong>Chapter Ten</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Duiker is still following Coltaine’s army, unable to catch up, continually impressed by what Coltaine has done so far but still certain it will end in annihilation. Realizing that Coltaine’s vanguard will cross the Sekala River that night, he decides it will be his last chance to catch him. Making a dash between two rebel camps, he manages to reach Coltaine’s defenses. We get a quick time check from Captain Lull—it’s been three months that Duiker has been chasing Coltaine after his exit from Hissar. Duiker is escorted to a briefing with Coltaine, Bult, Captain Chenned (the captain from the wall in Hissar as they watched Coltaine’s arrival), Captain Lull, Captain Sulmar, Sormo and other young warlocks, and others. Coltaine sets plans for the crossing of the river and Sulmar tries to get the nobles’ priority treatment to cross first. Two nobles, Nethpara and Tumlit, interrupt and Nethpara presents a list of grievances, a request to cross earlier, and a complaint that the soldiers are getting more food rations. Tumlit wants to know why there are so many more wagons being used for wounded and why the sappers/engineers are crawling all over the wagons. Bult, at Coltaine’s command, throws them out. Others are dismissed. Coltaine asks Duiker about Kulp because Sormo can no longer sense him. Sormo says the warrens have become “difficult” due to Soletaken and D’ivers “infest[ing]” every warren and that he has been forced to turn to older ways, including enlisting the land’s spirits. Luckily, Reloe has no Elder knowledge and so can’t use magic against them. Coltaine tells Duiker they head for Ubaryd, a two-month journey. Duiker then tells them his story (leaving out his rescue attempt of Heboric) before heading to bed.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Duiker is woken by Corporal List and warns Baria Setral (the Red Blade Commander from earlier) that he’d heard the Semk tribe (with sorcerers) have joined Reloe’s army and will be making that flank tough on whomever is defending. As the crossing continues and skirmishes then the battle begins, Duiker and List make their way to a wall on the oxbow island in the river to observe. On their way, they meet Nether, a young girl (reincarnated warlock) of about nine or ten. She helps them make their way then goes on to face the Semk sorcerers. As Duiker and List head for the bridge, another young warlock, Nil, raises ancient zombie soldiers from prior battles on the land. The undead soldiers are followed by women and children, the women killing the children yet again as they had ages ago when they faced an inevitable loss. Nil alone sees both sides, sees that it was a clan war—kin killing kin over the “Antlered Chair.” Nil tells Duiker the Wickans had done the same until united by Kellanved’s contempt for their infighting and feuds and it was that which gave him their loyalty. The battle rages more fiercely as the Malazans are driven back to the river. Duiker is sure there has been mass drownings and they’ll all be killed due to the river holding them up, but the sappers have built a road across the river using the wagons and so the Malazans are able to cross swiftly and easily. One of the engineers, Cuttle, then blows the road with the peasant army vanguard still on it, leaving a trench and trapping Keloe’s army on that side of the river, leaving one army left to fight on the other, the Semk, who eventually retreats.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>The Malazans fortify their camp while Coltaine holds another meeting which recounts many losses (including the Setral brothers and the Red Blades). Sormo says they were lucky that the Semk god was such a cruel Ascendant as it uses its wizards to channel its power and rage, unconcerned with killing them as it does so. He adds that the god will simply choose more and “more extreme measures” will be needed to deal with it. Lull informs them that Ubaryd has fallen and the Malazan fleet left it, with tens of thousands more refugees fleeing toward Coltaine’s army. Bult says they have no choice now but to aim for Aren, 270 leagues away, and that they shouldn’t count on Fist Pormqual marching out of Aren to help them.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Nether wakes Duiker in the middle of the night and he follows her to where Sormo and Nil wait. Sormo shows him a cliff of ice with bodies in it, tells him it is Jaghut sorcery and that the Semk god is within it. The warlocks have called the land’s spirits and offered them pieces of the Semk Ascendant’s flesh and thus of its power. Sormo says it is actually mercy of a kind for the Semk Ascendant as all its undying anger will dissipate, though it will hurt the Semk wizards. Sormo allows the Ascendant to escape the ice and it is torn apart by the spirits.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>As they return to camp, Nethpara and Tumlit arrive with another noble, Lenestro. They are angry because Coltaine conscripted their servants, Tumlit because he is concerned about them, the other two because they have no servants. The chapter ends with the camp’s dogs all howling and Duiker, covered in blood, walking under a blood-red sky.</p><p><strong>Chapter Eleven</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Aboard Silanda, Kulp enters his warren to try and find a way to shift them out of the flooded Elder warren and into the real world. His warren has felt the passage of intruders, though luckily they are gone when he enters. As he tries to figure out if he can use Meanas to “trick reality” into letting them through, he feels a massively powerful presence nearing. He exits for a moment to tell Heboric to get everyone ready, then returns as the warren itself or someone in it (perhaps Shadowthrone, perhaps the Hounds) seems to react with “outrage” at whatever is nonchalantly passing through, one which seems to Kulp to have the power of Rake or Osric, though the former is on Genabackis and the latter rumored to have gone to a far southern continent a century ago. A massive dragon appears, though one unlike Rake or Osric’s draconian forms, and one which, Kulp realizes, is undead. As it passes, he uses Meanas to put Silanda into its wake, though the portal opens much wider than he’d planned, “wounding” his warren and flooding it with the water from the Elder warren. Shadows come to try and heal the wound and stem the water, but it appears futile. Calling on Shadowthrone and all other Ascendants, Kulp tries to “fool” reality into healing the rent. As he thinks he’s dying of the unsuccessful attempt, the dragon adds its power to his and the wound begins to seal. The dragon leaves him when other Ascendants join their power in as well (though only as if it were a “game”), and then, the wound sealed, they drop Kulp like he was nothing. After some rest, Kulp readies himself to try and move them out of the dragon’s wake into the real world.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Felisin, having watched and felt all this, now watches as they continue in the dragon’s wake, thinking how small they all were in relation to all that power, and how little in control of their lives. The dragon opens a portal and leads them into a realm of fire (to “sear the fleas from its hide” Felisin thinks). Baudin wraps Felisin in his arms to protect her and jumps overboard onto sand in a narrow gorge, though not before she sees Heboric fall overboard. The fire disappears as they land and Felisin realizes they’re back in the real world (thanks to the buzz of flies). Baudin looks “gilded. Tempered.” In Felisin’s eyes, it looks like he “feels” again. Baudin says he’s heavier and that something has changed. They make their way out to a range of hills over a valley and find Heboric and an unconscious Kulp beside him. Heboric tells them they’re on the mainland of Seven Cities. Kulp comes to and speculates the warren of fire (or fire between warrens) may have been chaos. He also notes that Felisin’s scars are fading. Felisin says the marines must be dead as they went below decks and the ship was on fire. When Felisin tells Baudin to go away, Heboric slips and says he would if he could, which lets Kulp figure out Baudin is her bodyguard. It all comes out:</p><p>Felisin is Tavore’s (the adjunct’s) sister.</p><p>Baudin is a Talon.</p><p>The Talons were formed as covert external military by Dancer.</p><p>The Claws were formed as secret internal police by Surly and when she became regent she sent the Claws after the Talons.</p><p>After they fought it out the Claws won, though some Talons went underground.</p><p>Tavore sent Baudin to protect Felisin and then get her out of the prison.</p><p>Baudin didn’t because she “didn’t want to go.”</p><p>Baudin’s father witnessed Dancer and Kellanved’s ascension in Malaz City.</p><p>Felisin tells Baudin to go away and he does, angering both Kulp and Heboric (as well as causing a strange “twist” in Felisin’s heart). Kulp gives Heboric the choice of sticking with her or not and he says yes, he owes her his life. When a sudden sandstorm of sorcery strikes, Kulp realizes they’re in Raraku. The storm covers them.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Mappo tells Fiddler Sha’ik was killed, assassinated by Red Blades according to Pust’s Deck reading. When Fiddler (who knows Deck readings) says he didn’t think Decks could be that precise, Mappo agrees. Fiddler is frustrated by Pust constantly delaying their departure, and thinks how Pust reminds him of Quick Ben—plans within plans. He tells Mappo he feels old and used up (recall Pust’s reading re the “weary sapper”) and that he knows Pust is up to something but can’t figure it out. Mappo thinks it has to do with Apsalar and Fiddler agrees. Mappo suspects Pust wants to force Apsalar into being the vessel for Sha’ik’s reincarnation and points out she’s has a lot of Dancer’s abilities and memories and recovering more memories of her possession time. Mappo suddenly realizes that Pust has been laying a false trail to the Path of Hands to divert the Soletaken and D’ivers from the real one in the temple (he also gives a mini-lecture on the shapeshifters to Fiddler). He also thinks Pust knows about him and Icarium, and plans to use them. Fiddler guesses as the last line of defense in case the shapeshifters discover the true gate. When he says they could just leave, Mappo says Icarium has his own quest so they’ll stay, and Fiddler tells him Pust is using their sense of honor and duty, knowing they’ll try and prevent the shapeshifters. Mappo suggests Pust will do the same with Fiddler’s group. They go to join the others, agreeing not to tell them of their suppositions.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>On their way out, Fiddler confirms that Icarium is obsessed with time, that he builds constructs to measure it all over the world (remember GoTM), that he is nearing his goal and that Mappo’s vow is to keep him ignorant of his past. When Fiddler says without one’s past, without history, there is “no growth,” Mappo agrees. Fiddler wonders how Icarium remains friends with Mappo, and so generous in general, without memories. They find Crokus assaulting Pust in front of Apsalar while Shadows gather (to protect Pust). Fiddler separates them and Crokus says Pust wants Apsalar to become Sha’ik. Fiddler says it’s up to her and when Apsalar says she won’t be used by an Ascendant again, Pust says she won’t be a tool but would command. She says no, Pust notes she’s still linked to Dancer, and then the two of them exit. Icarium enters and Mappo tells Crokus and Fiddler they think Servant is Apsalar’s father. They realize Shadowthrone took him as leverage and that Servant has gone after Sha’ik’s body. Mappo asks if Fiddler will go with him after Servant and Fiddler agrees.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Mappo collects an odd weapon formed of the large long-bone of a massive skeleton dug up by his clans centuries ago, a bone that had its own sorcerous power that was then enhanced by Trell witches. He also has a sack that is its own private warren (into which he has sometimes stuffed entire people). Icarium tells him Apsalar has gone after her father. Mappo, and then Icarium, theorize that perhaps Sha’ik planned this from the start and/or also that Shadowthrone and Dancer had never planned on a possessed Apsalar going after Laseen, but a once-possessed one now having his skills but without him (detectably) in her taking the role of Sha’ik, defeating the Malazans, thus forcing Laseen to come and then killing her, putting Apsalar on the throne with Dancer and Kellanved as patron gods. Icarium says he feels he’ll find answers at Tremorlor and asks Mappo how it will change him, if Mappo will reveal his memories. Mappo tells him Icarium is not dependent on Mappo’s memories and shouldn’t aim to become his “version” of Icarium. Icarium says he thinks Mappo is part of his hidden truth and Mappo fears this statement because it is further than Icarium has ever taken this line. They agree that Icarium may have a decision to make at Tremorlor.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Fiddler is waiting outside. He senses tension between Mappo and Icarium and thinks changes are coming to them all. He’d caught Crokus practicing knifework earlier, showing improvement and a colder air. They head out.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Kalam is observing Korbolo Dom’s camp, circled by rows of crucified prisoners. He hates the feeling of helplessness, of having no effect. He thinks of how the Empire’s threat was always “we deliver your destruction back on you tenfold,” and hopes that if he kills Laseen a better will take her place and he and Quick Ben have someone in mind. He returns to the others (Keneb is worse) and tells them they can’t go through or around. He pulls out a rock from Quick Ben, a “shaved knuckle.” He breaks it and they end up in the Imperial Warren which extends far further than the rumors he had heard. He decides to use it to head toward Aren (rather than Unta).</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Lostar Yil, following Kalam, faces the portal as Pearl exits. He alludes to “primitive” presences using it and that this portal in this place shouldn’t exist. The two of them enter the warren.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Seven hours later, the portal is still open. Dom’s camp is up in arms as 1300 Malazan children that had been crucified had disappeared. Shadows are all over the place. Apt appears holding a young boy, his face chewed and pecked, lacking eyes and a nose. Shadowthrone appears with the Hounds and after saying he was surprised as he’d thought to have lost Apt to Sha’ik, he asks what he’s supposed to do with all these kids, growing angry as he presses her. Apt appears to answer that Kalam wanted to save them and Shadowthrone says of course he did but knew it was impossible, that only vengeance was possible, but now Shadowthrone has to exhaust himself to heal them all. Apt seems to suggest servants. Shadowthrone scoffs at first but then seems to get an idea, something about the “ambivalence in their scarred, malleable souls.” He agrees to take them but Apt says she wants to keep the one boy. He wonders how Apt will resolve possible conflict between the boy and protecting Kalam and she has an answer of some “nerve.” Shadowthrone agrees but says while he can heal the body, the mind will retain scars and the boy will be “unpredictable.” He heals the boy but gives him a single, Aptorian eye rather than human ones at Apt’s request. Shadowthrone worries aloud about Pust’s ability to pull off the deception with regard to the shapeshifters and the Path of Hands. Apt and the boy enter the warren to keep after Kalam.</p><p><strong>Chapter Twelve</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Duiker rides with the army and catalogs its many losses, deprivations, the seeming futility, the rumors swirling. Captain Lull finds him to tell him he’s “volunteered” to go after the new enemy commander that been harassing them with such deadly effectiveness. Lull notes that Corporal List, alongside Duiker, is feverish for lack of water and has Nether take him to a healer. Lull tells him they anticipate another battle on the other side of the next river they’ll cross (roughly nine days).</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>They meet Lull’s squad and Nil, who has narrowed down the war leader’s position somewhat. Nil tells Duiker the Malazan professional soldier is the deadliest weapon he has seen. The warlocks call a hiding fog down while some sappers set off a munitions diversion. As they head out, Duiker thinks it’s been a long time since he’s actually fought, his perk as Imperial Historian being not fighting in the front lines, as well as being given alchemies to extend his life He recalls the Emperor pulling him out to make him historian, assigning Toc the Elder to teach him to read and write (Kellanved said he had other plans for Toc the Elder). Duiker thinks sadly of how Toc the Elder vanished after Laseen took over and how Toc the Younger had been lost in the Genabackan campaign. The warlocks open a tunnel in the ground and the squad heads downward, much to Duiker’s dismay. The tunnel slowly fills with water so they travel through a stream, until they finally exit near a campfire of a half-dozen Tithsani warriors, the ground strangely frosty. The war leader and Semk with his mouth sewn shut enter the camp. The marines kill the warleader and several of the warriors, while a clawed beast is called from the earth by the warlocks and kills a few others, but the Semk is unbothered by arrows and starts to kill the beast while more Tithansi warriors arrive. Nil is unconscious and the other warlock being killed by sorcery. Duiker realizes the Semk is being controlled by a surviving piece of the Semk god the Malazans had thought they’d killed earlier. Sappers use munitions to try and open a route out. A woman marine carries Nil while Duiker covers her. They’re attacked and Duiker kills two but the third is killed by a Claw weapon (the second evidence of such a killing) and when Duiker, after getting back to camp, asks Lull what other secrets Coltaine is keeping, Lull tells him he’s sure Coltaine doesn’t know about any Claw but he’ll want to.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Duiker tells Coltaine, who is surprised by the news while Bult is skeptical. Sormo enters and tells them the Semk god was indeed killed and torn apart, but that one of the pieces had corrupted the earth spirit that had devoured it. He says the other spirits will deal with it and blunt its attacks. He says this sort of magic is ancient, from before warrens when magic “was found within.” When Coltaine mentions water rationing, Duiker reminds them the tunnel they created had water in it and they realize they’ve been suffering needlessly.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>The warlocks open pits and tunnels and dole out water.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Kulp, Felisin, and Heboric have been trapped by the Whirlwind sandstorm for three days. Kulp feels it’s almost as if the goddess singled them out. They take shelter in caves the storm has carved into a mesa. They discover it’s a buried city and move farther in. Heboric, weak and feverish, mutters about how “They tried it here . . . and paid for it . . . There was retribution . . . a cleaning-up of the mess . . . First Empire . . . They came and put things aright. Immortal custodians.” They find a hole above that will lead them in farther, so Felisin climbs a quartz pillar (despite incredible pain), then Heboric uses his ghost hands to first throw Kulp through up through the hole then to climb up the rope they lower for him.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Felisin watches Heboric fearfully. She feels “emptied, with nothing left in me to rebuild.” Kulp figures out the room they’ve entered was once flooded. Finding a door he pushed against it and when it falls more easily than expected, he plunges through the opening and down steps, breaking his nose. The new room is filled with what Felisin first takes as sculptures, but are actual people. Heboric tells them their children “chose the path of the Soletaken” as an “alternative to Ascension” and that the elders had tried to create a new, safer version of the ritual for their children. He also says they’d extended their lives via alchemies, but the ritual killed them. The city was later flooded, after the “immortal custodians [the T’lan Imass] had already come and gone.” As they head toward where Heboric says water may be in the city, Felisin thinks that she has some of Hood in her or with her, wonders if that’s where her dreams of rivers of blood come from. They find more bodies in the streets, these ones partially veered, killed by violence, the shapeshifting ritual gone madly out of control until stopped by the Imass, whom Heboric says have a “bond” with Soletaken and D’ivers. He also identifies the city as First Empire. Heboric theorizes the shapeshifters they’ve met are heading to the ancient gate and tells them the undead dragon they saw while on Silanda was a T’lan Imass bonecaster. They find a fountain and Heboric tells them that due to the alchemies in the water there will be “benefits” from drinking it. They drink.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Kalam’s group appears lost. Kalam can’t figure out why that haven’t exited the Imperial Warren, despite his visualizing Aren in detail. They see clouds and prints and then smell the scent of shapeshifting. Investigating a pit, Kalam realizes they’re walking on a huge layered bed of ash from an entire land being incinerated, including living beings—“millions.” At the bottom he also finds strange mechanisms which remind him of Icarium’s machine in Darujhistan. Keneb says he’d heard a rumor that Icarium had been seen, then tells Kalam that Deck readers had lately been unable to get past the first card, which kept coming up as Obelisk, an Unaligned card, and that one Seer had said it was due to Icarium.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Kalam’s group comes across a sunken road and decide to camp down there. Keneb tells Kalam about Minala, that her husband would beat her, force heal her, then beat her again. Keneb says he didn’t know about it until the very end and was on his way to the husband when the attack came. When Kalam asks how her husband died, Keneb refuses to say. He then says Minala had set herself up as protector of Selv and the kids, but now feels unnecessary with Kalam around. Kalam says he doesn’t think she trusts him.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Fiddler and the others are following Apsalar as she tries to catch up to Servant, on his way to Sha’ik’s body. The place is rife with Sha’ik’s warriors as well as Soletaken and D’ivers. Two warriors suddenly appear and before Fiddler can do anything giant spiders swarm over them and kill them. They come across another warrior, this one killed by Apsalar. Mappo tells them they are now walking the Path of Hands. As they continue, Fiddler ponders Apsalar as Sha’ik and thinks while her skills would be useful, they don’t offer what she needs to lead, and he thinks he’s known only a few that had such skills: Dassem Ultor, Prince K’azz D’Avore of the Crimson Guard, Caladan Brood, Dujek, Tattersail, Whiskeyjack. Fiddler worries about Crokus, how upset he seems about Apsalar going off without saying anything. He also suspects Apsalar’s father was a willing participant in putting Apsalar in this position.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>Pearl and Lostara have stopped before a portal as Pearl tries to decide whether to explore it (a “detour”) or continue after Kalam. He also informs Lostara they are being followed. He decides to do the detour as “assistance is required,” even though Laseen has made dealing with Kalam a priority as she thinks he presents a “personal risk.” He tells Lostara they will be attacking Whirlwind soldiers (helping Coltaine), and she agrees to go. He warns her to stay unseen and to also stay away from a Semk demon. They enter the fight and Lostara kills some Tithansi warriors. They face the Semk demon (the one with his mouth sewn shut in scene 2) who throws them aside, badly hurting Lostara. Pearl stands between her and the demon, though he seems to Lostara to consider himself dead already. Then Apt suddenly appears with the boy atop her. She plunges her hand into the demon’s body and pulls out an object and flings it away. Pearl thanks Apt, opens a portal, and Lostara goes unconscious.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Thirteen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>As Duiker walks through the camp, a large cattle-dog runs by with a lapdog in its mouth, chased by several nobles. One of the nobles, Pullyk Alar, seems about to challenge Duiker when List rides up and interrupts, calling Duiker to a meeting. As they head to the meeting, they come across another group of nobles who watch as Lenestro whips one of his servants. Duiker steps in and stops it and tells Lenestro they’re taking the servant to the healer and he won’t be returned. When Lenestro protests Duiker shakes him and Lenestro faints. When Nepthara protests List tells him Lenestro was lucky Duiker, whose name is “among the Noted on the First Army’s Column at Unta”, didn’t just kill Lenestro. As they continue on toward the meeting, List confesses he doesn’t believe they’ll get to Aren. In the meeting, Sormo says a strange demon badly damaged the Semk demon and that Nil had seen Apt and the boy. It remains a mystery. Coltaine tells them they’ll have to go through Kamist Reloe’s army on the other side of the river P’atha and that Duiker will ride with the marines. Told of the servant problem, Coltaine decides to use some of the gold they’re carrying (the soldiers’ pay) to just buy all the servants.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>At night, Coltaine joins Duiker where he sits and tells him their scouts are having a hard time seeing what Reloe has planned. He also says there is a second army that he plans on beating to the next river, Vathar, by two days, though the river is still months away. When Duiker asks if that second army is Sha’ik, Coltaine says no and says perhaps she hasn’t released the Whirlwind yet because she’s heard Tavore is assembling the Malazan legions in Unta and preparing to leave for Seven Cities. Coltaine leaves and Duiker roams the camp. He finds Wickans putting heavy armor (unusual for Wickans) on their horses and themselves. Duiker continues wandering, watching soldiers preparing the morning’s battle. He finds Corporal List and Captain Lull with the marines. Lull tells him that the refugees are being held back from the battle, guarded by the Weasel Clan. Captain Chenned and Captain Sulmar shows up and Sulmer says the sappers have all deserted, but Lull suspects they’re up to something. Chenned exits with an old-time phrase (“save me a patch of grass when you go down”) and Lull informs him that Chenned’s father was in Dassem’s First Sword (as was Temper from NoK).</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Duiker marches forward with List and the unnamed female marine from the Semk demon night. Reloe had built a ramp before Coltaine’s army with steep sides forcing Coltaine’s army toward only one exit (and uphill). List seems to resent not having been in the mix of things due to being assigned to Duiker. The Seventh marches up the ramp and engages, but before Duiker gets involved, he’s turned by List to watch as Nil and Nether lead a single horse into sight and stand with their hands on it. Then Duiker enters the fighting for a while until the signal to split. The sappers, who had buried themselves in the banks of the ramp overnight, suddenly appear, throw munitions into the first line of Reloe’s army, then the heavy cavalry Duiker had seen last night charges up the ramp over sappers lying on the ground with shields on their back. Duiker realizes the charge hand been unnaturally strong and fast and sees Nil and Nether still standing to either side of the single horse. Eventually Reloe’s army breaks and runs. Lull appears and tells Duiker that Coltaine’s group is mocked for its noble-born, the army is called the Chain of Dogs because Coltaine “leads yet is led, he strains forward, yet is held back, he bares his fangs, yet what nips at his heels if not those he is sworn to protect.” Duiker looks up and sees that Lull has lost an eye and his nose due to a mace wound.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>The Weasel Clan had used some of the refugees as bait, losing hundreds of them, which outraged the refugees and especially the nobles. The land’s spirits had destroyed the Semk demon and the Semk god’s remnant. The Weasel Clan slaughtered nearly the entire Tithansi tribe, as well as the peasant army. Duiker recalls coming across Nil and Nether, their hands covered in blood, with the mare which though still standing was dead and he is horrified that despite its sacrifice giving strength to the cavalry and saving lives, it died with “a dumb beast’s incomprehension at its own destruction beneath the loving hands of two heartbroken children.”</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Kalam’s group comes across an ash-covered dome. When Kalam wipes some ash away it reveals a symbol he recognizes from a Genabackis battle against one of Brood’s company, the one led by Kallor, who called himself High King and claimed to have “once commanded empires, each one making the Malazan Empire no larger than a province . . . [and] to have destroyed them by his own hand, destroyed them utterly . . . made worlds lifeless.” More focused, Kalam is able to open a portal into Aren.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>While the others rest and bathe, Kalam sits in the main room of an Aren tavern where he meets a Napan ship captain who tells him some mysterious stranger calling himself Salk Elan has booked Kalam passage aboard his ship, Ragstopper, to Unta. The captain says he’s sailing in two days with twenty marines, the High Fist’s treasurer, and much of Aren’s treasury.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Kalam tells Minala he’s going to go (though he can’t figure out how Elan knew Kalam would be in Aren, let alone in that tavern needing to get to Unta) and that she and the others should get out of Aren. He gives her the stallion and says he wishes things could have been different. He leaves with the captain of the Ragstopper.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Lostara leaves Pearl to go report to the head of the Red Blades in Aren. In the streets she is arrested by a group of High Fist’s soldiers as all the Red Blades have been for treason.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Minala says goodbye to Keneb and takes off after Kalam.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Fourteen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Kulp presses the others to move on due to the presence of shapeshifters nearby. When Heboric bemoans the coincidence of the Whirlwind rising at the same time of the Soletaken/D’ivers, Kulp says it wasn’t accidental, that someone started the shapeshifters on the convergence due to the uprising or perhaps the goddess began the Whirlwind to mesh with the convergence. Felisin suggests letting themselves be bitten (to become shapeshifters) and Kulp tells her that’s a common misperception, that a bite would only result in a cycle of madness but real shapeshifters are born. Heboric leads them on.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Felisin notes the water has made her feel “mended,” but she still feels hopeless. Heboric leads them through the city, which is filled with bodies killed in the battle with the T’lan Imass, all the death leading Felisin to despair and thoughts that all of humanity’s action means nothing, affects nothing, that all that lies beneath is futility. They come to a temple whose frieze is an Elder Deck showing the Holds. Heboric asks Kulp to find the Hold of the Beast and Kulp tells him the throne is empty and is flanked by T’lan Imass. Heboric says the Throne used to be filled. He asks Kulp if he sees the Unaligned (Kulp can’t) and among them would be Shapeshifters. They walk through the temple then exit onto a ledge high on a cliff face above the Whirlwind. Kulp and Felisin tie themselves to Heboric who will climb down using his ghost hands.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Heboric climbs down, through the Whirlwind which scours Felisin’s skin painfully raw. When they read the bottom, Felisin looks up and thinks she sees a figure on the ledge above them. They feel something coming/nearby and run, suddenly breaking into a calm spot, like the eye of a storm. In it are four men carrying a palanquin bearing up a “corpulent figure wearing voluminous silks” and carrying a parasol. He offers them healing unguents, food, and water and asks if Felisin is for sale. Kulp points out his porters are undead and appear to have been chewed. When questioned how he manages to oppose the Whirlwind, the newcomer says he’s a merchant who trades with Sha’ik’s rebels so the Whirlwind gives him passage. As his servants set up camp, the newcomer observes that Heboric is a former priest of Fener and Kulp a mage of Meanas and introduces himself as Nawahl Ebur. Kulp tells Felisin the salves really are healing and she uses it to heal herself. Nawahl pulls out lanterns and wine and food. A huge Soletaken bear tries to enter the protected area but cannot. Kulp moves closer to look and as he turns back to the merchant Nawahl shapeshifts into hundreds of rats that swarm over Kulp. Heboric enters the mass, his hands glowing (one red, one green) killing each rat he touches but the swarm spreads then drops from where Kulp had been, leaving just a mass of bones and his cape. As the Soletaken bear even more frantically tries to enter, getting a forearm in, the rats head for Heboric. Suddenly, Baudin appears and dashes the oil lanterns to the ground amid the rats, who attack him. He breaks three more lanterns and fire engulfs him and the rats. Felisin goes to Heboric and pulls him away. In her head, Nawahl offers her wealth and peace and indulgence and tells her not to go, that he will deal with Baudin and Heboric and the Soletaken bear (now revealed to be Messremb). Felisin hesitates but thinks the D’ivers rats are losing. As she pushes Heboric away the protections collapse and Messremb charges in.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Felisin finds shelter for them nearby then falls asleep. She wakes to the storm being over. Heboric tells her the rat bites have poisoned him and wars with “the other strangers in my soul.” Baudin appears—“burned, gnawed, parts completely eaten away.” He drops to the ground and Felisin cradles his head in her lap. Baudin whispers to her she was not what he expected, then dies. Felisin’s “armor” “falls away.”</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Mappo tells the group Apsalar and her father are now walking the path together. Both he and Fiddler sense “expectancy” in the air from the Whirlwind goddess. Icarium mentions they’ve gone through two warrens on the path, “ancient and fragmented, woven in the very rock of Raraku” and that once he smelled the sea. Mappo points out Apsalar could easily evade them and so must be leading them. Fiddler wonders if, knowing what he and Kalam had planned with regard to Laseen, she is contemplating taking on Sha’ik so as to further that plan. Mappo warns Fiddler that if she becomes Sha’ik reborn, Apsalar will be changed by the goddess, will take on the goddess’ cause. Fiddler says she’s arrogant enough to think that won’t be the case. Crokus wonders if she’s been repossessed by Cotillion so he and Shadowthrone can use the Whirlwind to wreak vengeance on Laseen. Fiddler worries that Gods ruling a mortal empire would draw other Ascendants into the mix and lead to devastating results.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Back at Sha’ik’s corpse, Leoman also feels a change in the air, the sense of expectancy. The Toblakai plans to leave, thinks Sha’ik will not be reborn, but Leoman isn’t ready. Felisin and Heboric appear. Leoman kneels before her and tells her “you are reborn.” Felisin answers, “So I am.”</p><p><strong>Chapter Fifteen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Kalam is checking out the ship that has been procured for his passage. One of the sailors mentions that Korbolo Dom and Relo’s armies have merged and plan to catch Coltaine at the Vathar River. The sailor points to High Fist Pormqual’s seal on much of the loading and guesses Pormqual is “turning tail.” He tells Kalam their last job was hauling weapons for Tavore’s fleet. When Kalam asks about an escort, the sailor informs him that Pormqual has commanded Nok’s fleet to stay in Aren Harbor. Across the bay a Malazan transport is unloading horses. The captain arrives, accompanied by a man and his two bodyguards. Salk Elan appears behind Kalam (surprising Kalam) and identifies the man as Pormqual’s treasurer. Questioned by Kalam, Elan tells him he arranged Kalam’s passage to pay off an obligation to Mebra (the one who gave Kalam the Whirlwind book in Ehriltan), who had guessed Kalam would try to assassinate Laseen. Elan goes on to say he’s leaving Aren due to a recent bounty on his head. When the treasurer starts to harangue the captain, Elan steps in. Before Elan and the bodyguards get into it, the captain starts to explain what’s going to happen when the treasurer suddenly goes unconscious. When Elan and Kalam join the captain in his cabin, he tells them Nok has been arrested by Pormqual, there appear to be no Claws in Aren, the treasurer has been given technical command of Ragstopper, and the Malazan transport has also been commandeered by Pormqual and will carry his household and horses to Unta.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>When Kalam asks Elan why no Claws, Elan says he knows nothing about “those horrid throat-slitters,” before leaving. Kalam suspects Elan is a mage and a good fighter.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Minala, sneaking aboard the transport with Kalam’s horse, thinks she’ll never see her sister or Keneb—who has been attached to Blistig’s City Garrison—again.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Captain Sulmar presses Coltaine to listen to the nobles’ suggestion to try and retake Ubaryd. When he asks about water beyond the Vathar, Bult says the warlocks can sense nothing past the river. Duiker notes how aged Sormo now looks and worries that Nil and Nether hadn’t exited their wagon since their magic with the horse at the last battle. Coltaine strips Sulmar of his rank and Sulmar says he has the right of appeal to a High Fist. Bult agrees and says the nearest one is in Aren. When Sulmar says taking Ubaryd would allow Nok to rescue them, Bult tells him Nok must be dead or arrested if he hasn’t left Aren, and that Pormqual is paralyzed. When Sulmar asks Duiker his opinion he explains why Ubaryd would be a disaster and also that Korbolo is an actual general while Reloe was just a mage. Bult mockingly suggests getting yet another opinion from Bent the ugly cattle-dog. Duiker actually feel a bit bad for Sulmar, caught in a bad position due to his noble blood. He recalls Kellanved purging the army of its nobles and turning the army into a meritocracy, with the help of Laseen’s Claw. He thinks Laseen didn’t learn from that, though. When Lull asks Duiker about List, Duiker says he’s mending but the healers are breaking down. Lull then asks about the forest past the river and Duiker tells him it was once on both sides but the Ubaryd’s shipbuilders deforested it, along with the introduction of goats. Duiker wonders how Coltaine will defend the group in a forest.</p><p>Lull and Duiker pass the herds of animals, which will be slaughtered at the river since the land beyond, seemingly empty of spirits, will not sustain them. He thinks how they will sense their impending deaths as they near, and then thinks again of the horse killed by Nil and Nether. Lull tells Duiker it’s rumored the children’s’ hands are permanently stained black with the mare’s blood and Duiker muses that the Wickans know power never comes free. Lull tells him he actually wants Korbolo to come just to end it all, that he cannot see whatever hope Coltaine does and Duiker answers he doesn’t believe Coltaine is hopeful any more. When Lull compares them to the herds waiting for slaughter Duiker answers that unfortunately people don’t get the gift of mindlessness and Lull will find no salvation there. Lull replies he doesn’t want salvation, just a way “to keep going.”</p><p>They arrive at a meeting between Coltaine and the former slaves. He gives them uniforms and a medallion with a cattle-dog’s head on it and tells them that last night the nobles tried to buy them back and Coltaine refused for they were soldiers of the Seventh now, not slaves. Lull tells Duiker that as slaves they might have survived, but as soldiers they will certainly die and tells Duiker to make sure he writes of this. Duiker thinks Lull is a broken man.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>List’s wound had become infected and a Wickan horsewife had treated it with moldy bread. List is now getting better and tells Duiker his fever had come with visions of something terrible that had happened in this land long ago, and when he describes the “god” that gave him the visions, Duiker recognizes it as a Jaghut.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Heboric tells Felisin that Leoman and Toblakai are ready to move on to Sha’ik’s oasis and that he and Felisin need them to survive, whether or not she opens the book. Felisin tells him that Sha’ik’s rebellion will call down a retributive army and it will be led by the adjunct, her sister. She tells Leoman they’ll head out but she won’t open the book yet. She also tells Heboric she’s going to keep him with her. As they walk, Heboric says Raraku continues to reveal her secrets to him, which angers Leoman. Heboric says he also sees all the spirits the Toblakai killed writing in his wake. Though the Toblakai sneers, he pales at Heboric’s words. As they continue on, Heboric says he knows of scholars who “claim they can map entire extinct cultures through the study of “ pottery shards. Felisin tells him one cannot be remade until one is broken and then asks if Heboric has learned any truths. He replies he’s learned there are not truths, to which Leoman answers Raraku and the Whirlwind are truths, as are weapons and blood. Heboric says this area was once sea and notes how the death of cities and civilizations is cyclical and that being witness to such inevitable rise and fall must be why long-lived Ascendants grow hard and cold. Out of earshot, Heboric tells Felisin Leoman doesn’t totally believe she’s Sha’ik reborn and worries he wants her as just a figurehead, but she says she’s not worried. When he asks why she keeps him around, she tells him for Baudin. Heboric says perhaps he and she will in fact one day understand each other.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>They come to an ancient harbor and find several corpses killed by a shapeshifter. Toblakai goes to hunt the shapeshifter. When Heboric says he’ll be killed, Leoman tell him that Sha’ik saw far into his future and what she saw “appalled” her. He then tells Felisin when she goes through the ritual (he says she must before they enter the city) the visions will be hers. And that if she isn’t the real Sha’ik she’ll be killed by the ritual.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Fiddler’s group come to an ancient island rising above a desert plain which had been an ancient bay. Mappo and Fiddler watch Icarium climb an old sea wall. Fiddler says it looks like Icarium knows his way and Mappo tells him Icarium has wandered this land before, while in his mind he worries that Icarium appears to be recalling more than usual. As they follow Icarium, Fiddler tells Crokus the city was long dead before the sea dried up and recalls how when the Emperor dredged Malaz Bay it had revealed old sea walls showing the city was even older than thought. And, Mappo added, that the sea levels had risen since then. Looking down from the sea wall they sea the city had been destroyed by “cataclysmic force and fury.” Mappo hears a high keening in his head and follows it as well as an internal recollection of the city based on old legend and suddenly he knew where they were—a First Empire city—and what Icarium would find. He locates Icarium in the center, where seven massive scorpion-sting thrones had been destroyed by “sword blows, by an unbreakable weapon in hands powered by a rage almost impossible to comprehend.” All offerings and tributes had been destroyed save a single mechanism—one of Icarium’s time-measuring devices. Icarium asks Mappo why it wasn’t destroyed while everything else was and tells Mappo if he reads it right he put it here 94,000 years ago. He asks who destroyed the city and says from the signs it was someone powerful, that the T’lan Imass arrived and tried to drive him back to honor their alliance with the city but were slain by the thousands something even a Jaghut couldn’t do (and the K’Chain Che’Malle were already extinct). Mappo tells him it must have been an Ascendant, a god or goddess, one who drifted long from mortal minds because he can’t think of a known one that would “unleash such power on the mortal plain.” Icarium replies that they could but choose rather to be more subtle meddling with mortals as the old ways proved too dangerous.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Mappo flashes back to when he was assigned the task of being Icarium’s guardian. He’d asked his tribe’s shoulder woman about the Nameless Ones. She told him they were once sworn to a god but were “cast out, cast down. In the time of the First Empire . . . they were the left hand, another sect the right hand . . . mysteries of another led them astray. They bowed to a new master.” He thinks he’s since figured out who/what that new master is.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>They leave the city and continue on after Apsalar and her father. Mappo realizes they are no longer heading for Sha’ik but for Tremorlor. Crokus, who has been waiting and watching, finds Pust shadowing them. Amidst Pust’s seeming ravings, he mentions how his deceit has been successful and that the key was to knowing that warrens can be “torn into fragments” and that Fiddler’s group has been wandering “more than one world.” Mappo remembers legends that Icarium came from Raraku and wonders if the broken warren is where Icarium’s long nightmare began. They catch up to Apsalar and her father on the threshold of, according to Pust, “a knotted torn piece of warren” into which his false Path of Hands has led the shapeshifters. When Crokus asks why they were led here, Pust says Servant will use what’s in the warren to go home. Mappo senses that while the aura or echo of a god still clings to Apsalar, she had made it all her own. Icarium tells Mappo that he wonders if the rumors that the Azath are a benign force to keep power in check and arise when needed are true. Mappo theorizes (in his head) that the torn warren Pust references would wander and deliver “horror and chaos” save that Tremorlor holds it fast, though Raraku has been twisted at the warren’s edges. Apsalar’s father (Rellock) asks them to talk Apsalar out of going any farther and tells them he led them there to pay his debt to Pust/Shadowthrone for sparing Apsalar’s life and giving him his arm back. They all agree to go in, and Pust’s last words (which he says they cannot hear) are “beware sleight of hand. Compared to the Azath, my immortal lords are but fumbling children.”</p><p><strong>Chapter Sixteen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>The Chain nears the Vathar River. List tells Duiker that the head of Korbolo Dom’s army has been spotted trying to beat them to the river (Reloe’s army is behind the Chain) and that Duiker is to ride ahead of the Chain with the Foolish Dog clan. At a meeting, Coltaine asks Duiker if he’s seen the sapper captain and says he’s beginning to wonder if they even have one. Bult tries to spear a lapdog that’s been tormenting him. Nether joins Duiker to ride ahead.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>On the ride, Duiker thinks he sees the cattledog Bent carrying the little lapdog in its mouth. The forest is filled with swarms of migrating butterflies which Duiker hopes might slow Dom’s army, but Nether tells him a mage is clearing their path by opening a warren and letting the butterflies vanish into it, meaning the enemy army is no longer hindered by the shapeshifters in the warrens. They reach the river crossing and see a burned ship riding there (Silanda). Duiker recognizes Gesler and Stormy from when he and Kulp were in the village, but notes they and Truth have a strange bronze coloring to their skin.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Dom’s advance arrives but rather than attacking sets up a camp nearby and starts cutting down trees. Duiker tries to convince Stormy and Gesler they’re back in the army now. Stormy and Gesler tell them about the Silanda, the headless Tiste Andii and undead rowers, and how they had but then lost Heboric and the others. They decide to scout Dom’s group using the Silanda’s dory.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>They see Dom sending archers and soldiers across the river via ropes spanning the cliffs.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>The rest of Dom’s forces arrive and fell more trees and set up on both sides of the river crossing. Duiker wonders why he hasn’t attacked and Nether guesses he’s waiting for Coltaine to show. Nether says the Silanda will take as many wounded as it can to Aren. She says Coltaine asks if Duiker wants to go with them and when Duiker immediately says no she tells him Coltaine had said that would be the response and wonders how Coltaine knows people so well, adding he’s a mystery as much to the Wickans as to the Malazans.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Coltaine arrives. He, Lull, Bult, and others meet with Stormy and Gesler. Lull says he knows of Gesler being demoted from captain to sergeant and now corporal and recalls that Stormy was once Cartheron Crust’s Adjutant. Gesler threatens to punch Lull if he even thinks about promoting Gesler, then Bult, and Coltaine. Coltaine punches Gesler and breaks his hand bloodying Gesler ‘s nose. Nil senses from Gesler’s blood that Gesler has nearly Ascended (and yet Coltaine bloodied him). A messenger arrives from Dom and offers to allow the refugees to cross the river unhindered. The nobles agree, making Duiker suspicious they had already been in communication with Dom’s army. Coltaine rejects the offer. Stormy tells Gesler things don’t seem right.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Felisin tells Leoman she will not dance to Sha’ik’s music. Toblakai returns having killed a giant white bear. Leoman pressures Felisin to perform the ritual. Felisin intones: The Toblakai “is pure faith yet shall one day lose it all,” Heboric will rediscover faith, Leoman is a “master deceiver” but searches always for hope despite his cynicism, and Felisin is as a crucible newly emptied. She tells Leoman to open the Book and he sees nothing in it but when Toblakai looks he weeps. Heboric refuses to look or touch it. Toblakai wants to kill him and when Felisin says “do it” (knowing he won’t be able to), Heboric’s hands flare visible and catch Toblakai’s wrists and send the sword flying, then Heboric throws Toblakai as well. Felisin tells Heboric he was never forsaken, he “was being prepared.”</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Fiddler’s group crosses the threshold into a forest. They see a huge boulder with red hand/paw prints on it. Mappo accuses Pust of it being more of his deception, but Icarium says the markings are real, but are Tellann (associated with the T’lan Imass), though the boulder is usually found on a hilltop. Pust wonders if Mappo’s sack is another piece of the warren. As they move forward Mappo wonders at how the number of roots seems too many for the number of trees. They come to a plain at the end of the forest, the plain covered in roots (despite the lack of trees): Tremorlor. Icarium senses the Azath is under siege by the warren trying to pull free and the Shapeshifters. They decide to rest a bit before continuing on.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Mappo asks Rellock why he agreed to take Apsalar into such danger. Rellock says she needs reasons and learning, that simply being granted, “knowing” by the god’s possession isn’t enough. He says like fishing, you “learn no place safe.”</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>Mappo hears Icarium and Apsalar talking. Apsalar says they’re both alike, both with protectors who can’t really protect them, especially from themselves. Icarium says it’s different with him and Mappo. Apsalar asks him what he’ll do with his memories when he finds them and he asks what does she do with hers. Apsalar says most of them aren’t actually hers: she has a handful of her own, some from a wax witch who protected her and then Cotillion’s. She says Cotillion killed to “fix things” and saw himself as honorable, as well as actually felt some sympathy for Laseen along with desire for vengeance. She then tells Icarium that though he thinks his memories will bring knowledge and understanding, in reality they tell us nothing about where we’re going and are a weight we can’t get rid of. When Icarium replies he’d accept that burden, she tells him not to say that to Mappo unless he wants to break Mappo’s heart. Icarium says he doesn’t understand but would never do that to Mappo. He repeats he doesn’t understand and when Apsalar says, “Yet you wish to,” he weeps.</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>As they prepare to continue, Mappo asks Icarium if he really wants to risk imprisonment by the Azath. Icarium says Mappo too will need to be wary, but that they need trust the Azath recognizes them as non-threats. He adds he can sense the Azath suffering and means to help it fight because its cause is just. Mappo thinks the Nameless Ones, his tribal Elders, and even his younger self would have given Icarium up to the Azath due to the risk he offers the world but he is unsure he can. Icarium senses Mappo at war with himself and tells Mappo he would give up his life for him. Mappo reveals the truth of the First Empire city to Icarium, that Icarium has destroyed entire cities and peoples and that Mappo’s job has been to prevent him from doing so again. Icarium says the Azath knows this and so must take him prisoner and that such would be suitable punishment. He asks Mappo to let Icarium be taken without resistance.</p><p>SCENE 12</p><p>The others clearly know what just happened between Icarium and Mappo and Fiddler tells him it was inevitable. Icarium tells them all to make no effort to save him should the House try and imprison him. Pust says the House need take him first to have his strength to fight off the shapeshifters. Icarium asks if he can fight without going crazy and Mappo says he does have a line to cross. Fiddler tells Icarium to hold himself back until the others have done all they can do. When Pust objects Crokus asks him what happens if Icarium kills the Azath (the idea of which stuns Icarium) and Shadowthrone sends the five Hounds of Shadow (two were killed by Rake in GoTM). Fiddler and Mappo make eye contact, sharing a distrust of the Hounds/Shadowthrone. Icarium says he welcomes them. They enter the House’s maze.</p><p>SCENE 13</p><p>Gesler and his group say goodbye and tell them they’ll try to convince Pormqual to help them. Sormo asks Duiker about List’s visions, says the warlocks sense nothing of the land. Duiker tells them there were a war fought there and that List’s visions of it come from a Jaghut ghost. Tumlit arrives and tells them another messenger from Dom arrived secretly and the nobles/refugees are going to cross. Coltaine tells his leaders to not contest the crossing and tells Duiker to send the sappers into the refugee group. Duiker and his nameless female marine join the refugees. Dom’s army has made a floating bridges packed with pikemen and archers. The rebels start slaughtering the refugees as they’re blocked at the ford, while the army is fighting in the rearguard. The arrows eventually taper off as the rebels run out or as the sappers push back on one side (Dom hadn’t planned on soldiers coming through with the refugees and the archers are only lightly armed). The desperate refugees attack the floating bridge when it nears them and the bridge sinks. Sormo uses sorcery to kill the rebels but then is killed himself. Butterflies in the hundreds of thousands converge on him. The refugees swarm Dom’s soldiers where Duiker is. Duiker comes across Nethpara and starts to strangle him but is prevented by someone who knocks him out.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Seventeen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Two privateers are following Kalam’s ship. Kalam can’t get to the bottom of the captain; he feels he’s trying to tell Kalam something. Kalam thinks of a warren he’s heard of that can lay a glamour on one’s mind. Time seems to be moving strangely aboard ship. Elan accuses the treasurer of being and helping a thief, and points out the crates below have the High Fist’s seal on them, not the empire’s. Elan tries to engage Kalam in conversation but Kalam refuses. He goes up top to find the crew preparing for a storm as well as using the storm to turn on the pirates. The captain tells Kalam it’ll be a night for knife work. Kalam seeks out the marine captain and asks if they’re loyal to the captain or the treasurer. At first she wants nothing to do with him, but when he tells her he’s a Bridgeburner she and Kalam come to an agreement whereby she implies they’ll support the captain. Kalam tells her to leave the treasurer’s bodyguards to him. One of the marines says he never believed the outlawing of Dujek and Kalam thinks the soldiers may be right. Ragstopper rams a pirate and battle ensues. Kalam finds the First Mate with his throat cut and the captain wounded (the captain killed one of the bodyguards) Elan helps Kalam with the captain the two agree that the treasurer is in league with the pirate ships (one of which is now destroyed) and the two agree to work together to protect the captain and stop the treasurer.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>The treasurer takes command and plans to surrender. Kalam gets the marines and crew ready. Elan kills the other bodyguard and they lure the raider in with a knife to the back of the treasurer. Battle starts as the pirate board and an enkar’al appears on board via a pirate mage and starts killing marines. Kalam severely wounds the enkar’al so the marines can kill it while Elan deals with the mage. Kalam and Elan and the marines win the battle.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>They load the treasurer with sacks of coin and toss him overboard.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Felisin puts on Sha’ik’s clothing. Leoman still doesn’t fully trust she is Sha’ik and continues to press the ritual, though he accepts she has come into some power Felisin puts him off. He warns her the High Mages will be trouble and she says she knows.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>The captain seems overly affected by his wound, having a hard time getting words out. Kalam again gets the sense the captain is trying to tell him something. More marines have died despite having a ship’s healer. They appear to be moving due to tradewinds but the captain tells Kalam there aren’t any in this area. Kalam again thinks of the glamour warrant.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>They spot Tavore’s fleet heading to Seven Cities. Elan asks Kalam if he wishes to be with the soldiers, if he’s caught between two desires. Elan tells Kalam the two should work together and mentions Kalam’s previous partners. When Kalam replies, “What makes you think I am alone now,” Elan gets nervous.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Eighteen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Fiddler’s group comes across the bodies of four Nameless Ones who appeared to be guarding the entrance. Icarium, looking at their staves, says he has seen these before in a dream, which he then recounts: he arrives at the edge of a Trell town that has been utterly destroyed, with Great Ravens feasting on the corpses. A Nameless One appears and from the power still pouring from her staff, Icarium realizes she has destroyed the town. She tells Icarium he must “not wander alone.” Her words recall horrible memories of past companions, “countless in number,” sometimes individuals and sometimes large groups, all of them betrayed and all of them eventually failing in keeping Icarium from doing what he does (he wonders if he himself killed many of them). The Nameless One’s staff flares and Icarium finds himself alone with his pain and memories gone. And then he wakes from the dream. Mappo thinks it’s impossible, that someone has tainted Icarium’s dreams. When Mappo identifies them as Nameless Ones, Icarium looks hard at him. Apsalar says the cult was supposed to be extinct. Pust says they claim to be Servants of the Azath and that Kellanved and Dancer’s Talons had purged them from the Empire. Just as Pust was about to say something about the Deadhouse, Apsalar stops him from revealing any more, which makes Icarium wonder if that was her or Dancer doing so. Apsalar says she’s tired of everyone wondering who she is, “as if I have no self.” She says she is “not a slave to what I was. I decide what to do with my knowledge.” Icarium apologizes and asks Mappo what more he knows about the Nameless Ones. Mappo says it’s rumored they date from the First Empire and it is they who recruited Icarium’s guardians, though nobody knows why (Rellock guesses guilt).</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Fiddler views hordes of arms and limbs and demons, Ascendants, etc. caught in Tremorlor’s roots. They can hear battles on all sides of them as they move through the maze, along with the Azath’s roots and branches being broken. Fiddler looks at how close Blind stays to Icarium and thinks he and Mappo are both suspicious that Shadowthrone had made a deal with the Azath that it wouldn’t take the Hounds and they’d help it take Icarium. Suddenly Messremb charges but not at the group; instead it attacks an enkar’al Soletaken about to attack. Mappo kills the Soletaken, but Rood attacks Messremb and pushes him against the maze wall where he’s held by a green-skinned arm around his neck. Rood tears one of Messremb’s arms off as Mappo is restrained by Icarium from going to help him. Icarium tries to comfort Mappo by telling him he’s being killed by the arm and so he won’t be imprisoned for eternity in the Azath.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Fiddler thinks there’s no way they can survive this, with thousands of shapeshifters there, meaning only the strongest will survive to the end. Shan arrives with lots of wounds. Icarium senses Gryllen coming and Mappo tries to hold him back. Fiddler turns to see Gryllen approaching as a “seething, swarming wall.”</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Felisin’s group is stopped by a young girl standing guard at the entrance to Sha’ik’s oasis camp. She is an orphan and thus nameless (nobody to speak for her in the naming ritual) and Felisin says if they will fight and die for her all the orphans have earned names and she herself will speak for them all. Heboric says the ancient city was destroyed by invaders. Leoman tells them there are 40, 000 “of the best-trained cavalry the world has ever seen.” Heboric says it doesn’t matter as the Malazan Empire always adapts its tactics, pointing out it’s already defeated a horse culture—the Wickans. When Leoman asks “how” Heboric says he doesn’t know—he isn’t a military historian—but Leoman could always try to read Duiker and others who were. Leoman has in fact and reels off the Malazan tactics. A crowd begins to gather and follow them, drawn by Felisin. Over Leoman’s objections, Felisin decides to address the crowd. Felisin wonders at how the goddess has been so amenable to a deal with Felisin: she will grant power to Felisin yet allow Felisin to remain Felisin, seemingly confident she’ll eventually give in. She tells the crowd that all but Aren has been liberated and that the Empress has sent a fleet commanded by her Adjunct. As she speaks, she reads the thoughts of the three High Mages, none of which kneeled when the crowd did. Bidithal had found the other Sha’ik as a child and “used [her] so brutally . . . broker her within her own body.” She says she has reserved a place for him in the Abyss but he will serve her until then and forces him to kneel. Febryl tried to poison her three times and years ago had fled from Dassem Ultor and betrayed Seven Cities but she will use him as bait to identify those who are against her and forces him to his knees. L’oric is a true mystery to her/Sha’ik, and has strong sorcerous shields she cannot pierce. He is a “pragmatist” and judges her every act and decision. He drops to one knee—a “half-measure”—of his own volition, which makes Felisin smile. She tells the crowd they will march and then raises the whirlwind into a giant column of dust and sand that towers overhead as the standard of Sha’ik’s army.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Fiddler’s group retreats from Gryllen, who has grown to encompass thousands or tens of thousands of rats, but end up trapped. Icarium throws Mappo to the ground and draws his sword. The sky reddens and forms a vortex. Shan attacks Icarium but gets swatted aside like he’s nothing. Fiddler reaches into his munitions bag for one of his last cusser and throws it but it was the conch shell from the Tano Spiritwalker Kimloc. Music fills the air and now it’s Gryllen who tries to retreat but begins withering, devoured, giving the song even more power. Everybody’s down on the ground, the Hounds cringing, Icarium knocked unconscious by Mappo. A wall of water appears, filled with the wreckage of the past: the remains of sunken ships, ancient metals, bones, etc and the wave buries them then disappears, the music gone to silence. Fiddler looks up to see the Hounds surrounding the unconscious Icarium and Mappo standing over the body to protect him. Fiddler tells Pust to call them off and Pust says this was the bargain. Fiddler shows Pust his bag and says he’ll fall on his own cusser and kill the Hounds if they don’t back off. Pust looks to Apsalar, but she agrees with Fiddler. They see the House just ahead and Mappo gently picks up Icarium and carries him.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Nineteen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>The chapter opens saying the Vather river crossing would later be known as “The Day of Pure Blood” and the Season of Sharks and that it would “hone [the] deadly edge” of the woman now sailing with the Empire’s fleet, a woman “hard as iron.” Coltaine lost over 20,000 refugees at the crossing and lots of soldiers, along with Sormo, and Dom continues to harass them. Lull asks Duiker, in all those books he’s read, “How does a mortal make answer to what his or her kind are capable of… Does each of us . . . reach a point when all that we’ve seen, survived, changes us inside . . . What do we become then? Less human, or morehuman.” Duiker tell him that everyone has their own threshold before crossing over “into something else . . . [into] a place not for answers . . . lost.” When Lull says he’ll go mad without an answer, Duiker replies “sleight of hand . . . illusion . . . wonder.” Which you’ll find, he goes on, in “unexpected places” where you’ll fight “both tears and a smile.” As they cross through the forest, they see T’lan Imass skulls in the trees, left from the ancient war in List’s dreams. The survivors of that war carried the T’lan Imass too shattered to go on here and hung them in the trees to watch, rather than bury the immortals in the ground. They pass as well cairns topped with skulls marking places the Jaghut turned and fought. Duiker and List find Coltaine, Bult, and Lull in the vanguard, along with the sappers. Coltaine tells the sappers that, due to their repeated bravery, several clan leaders have asked to adopt them. He says he had them withdraw as he assumed that is what the sappers would want. But, he continues, he will follow the traditions of the Empire and so he promotes one who showed “natural leadership” to sergeant. Lull and the others are informed by another sapper that Coltaine actually just demoted the man, since he had been their captain (Captain Mincer). Mincer then grabs a woman named Bungle, who had been his sergeant, and says she should be made captain. Coltaine and others try not to laugh, and Coltaine agrees to the promotion, suggestion Bungle listen to her sergeant. When asked why he never attended staff briefings, Bungle says it was because Mincer needed “beauty sleep.” She also mentions he carries a sack of rocks to throw when he breaks his sword, and there’s nothing he can’t hit. Save, Mincer interrupts, “that lapdog,” which causes Bult to choke in laughter/sympathy. Coltaine asks Duiker to make sure he records this moment and Duiker says he’ll get every word down. The sappers leave and Coltaine admits he didn’t know what to do or why they seemed to not mind him demoting a man for bravery. Lull says he “returned him [Mincer] to the ranks . . .And that lifted every one of them up.” As Duiker watches Lull, Coltaine, and Bult walk away still talking about it, he thinks back to his conversation with List: “Tears and smiles, something so small, so absurd, the only possible answer.”</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>List shows Duiker a ruined tower nearby and tells him it was Jaghut, that they lived alone as they feared each other as much as they feared the T’lan Imass. He says the tower is a few hundred millennia old and that they were pushed back by the T’lan Imass to tower after tower after tower (the last “in the heart of the plain beyond the forest.”) Duiker asks if this was a typical Jaghut-Imass war and List answers no, it was a unique bond among the Jaghut family, that when the mother was endangered the children and father joined the battle and things “escalated.” When Duiker muses she must have been “special,” List says yes, and that it is her mate who is his ghost guide. Suddenly, they feel something and turn to look and spot Sha’ik’s column rising to the sky.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Kalam is unnerved by the strangeness aboard Ragstopper: the blurry sense of time’s passage, the captain’s strange illness and seeming attempts to communicate something of importance to Kalam, the suspicion that Elan is a mage, an unusual storm driving them southeast. He finds a private spot and uses a magical stone to contact Quick Ben. Quick Ben speaks to him, seemingly under some pressure wherever he is. Kalam asks him to try and sense what is happening aboard Ragstopper. Quick tells Kalam he’s (Kalam) in trouble and the ship “stinks of a warren, one of the rarest among mortals” and that its purpose (or one of them) is confusion. When Kalam tells Quick that Fiddler and his group headed for Tremorlor, Quick Ben is upset because he’d suggested that possibility when things were at peace but now “every warren’s lit up” and “something’s gone bad there.” Kalam mentions the Path of Hands and Quick Ben gets more worried and says he’ll try and think of some way to help them, then trails away, saying he “lost too much blood yesterday.”</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Kalam finds Elan in the captain’s room. Elan tells him the storm is blowing them off course to Malaz City.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Mappo is beginning to doubt the story he’d been told of his town’s destruction by Icarium. He wonders if it matters, as there’s no doubt that Icarium has taken countless other lives. He vows the House will not take Icarium and he will fight it and any who try to help it do so. Fiddler confirms that Mappo is not so caught up in his own plight that he won’t help the group if needed.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>As Fiddler looks at his group, he realizes that not only Mappo but all of them will fight to keep Icarium from being taken, foolish as that may be. They can see the assault on Tremorlor is having an effect on the House, can hear the forest being destroyed. They sense something coming up behind them and hear a scream and a battle. From behind comes Moby and the Hounds shy away from him. Fiddler sees Moby is more than he appears and Pust says he just tore apart a shapeshifter. They can see the house now and decide to make a run for it. Apsalar leads, saying a house opened once for Dancer. When asked what it takes, she says “audacity.” Mappo says the conch shell did and is still doing damage to the shapeshifters and may prove enough for the Azath to survive. He asks Fiddler what it was and Fiddler answers he got it from Kimloc, the Tano Spiritwalker. Mappo deduces Kimloc must have touched Fiddler and learned of his plan to find Tremorlor and so crafted the shell in accordance. Above them opens a warren with four huge dhenrabi in it. Fiddler realizes the one he killed earlier in the book was part of a D’ivers. The Hounds attack the dhenrabi and kill several as the group watch, then they run for the House as a swarm of bloodflies heads their way. Apsalar tries the door but it won’t open.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>The army passes the first Jaghut tomb, a tilted stone slab. List tells Duiker it was the youngest son, his face looking horrible and Duiker realizes List’s ghost has been watching over the tomb and grieving in torture for two hundred thousand years. List says the boy was five and he was dragged to this spot, all his bones shattered, and then pinned beneath the rock (killing him would have cost the T’lan Imass too much). Duiker realizes the army is working in near silence and List says the father’s grief drove all the spirits away and hangs over all of them like a pall. He suggests moving quickly through this land, though he says things only get worse in the plain. Duiker wonders why the Imass did what they did and List says “pogroms need no reason . . . difference in kind is the first . . . Land, domination, pre-emptive attacks . . . just excuses that do nothing but disguise the simple distinction. They are not us. We are not them.” Duiker wants to know if the Jaghut tried to reason or negotiate and List says yes (save the Tyrants), but their innate arrogance “stung” the Imass. Duiker is skeptical it would do so enough to drive the Imass to swear a vow of immortal war and List answers that he didn’t think the Imass knew how long it would take to kill all the Jaghut, that the Jaghut never really flaunted their true power and that even when they used their power it was often passive and defensive, such as by creating barriers of ice (which the Imass could survive and pass by becoming dust).</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>As they march, the army is attacked by two tribes—the Tregyn and the Bhilard, while the third, the Khundryl, awaited them; people are starving, the herd animals are dying, and Dom’s army is growing behind them, now five times Coltaine’s number of soldiers. They enter a valley and see two large encampments of the Tregyn and Bhilard waiting.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Lull tells Duiker that the soldiers are dropping like flies due to thirst and he and Duiker both say something feels odd tonight, like “maybe Hood’s Warren has drawn closer.” At a command meeting, Coltaine says the warlocks have sensed something coming tonight. Duiker anticipates tomorrow’s battle will be a slaughter by Dom’s army. He thinks to offer “one word”—surrender?—but even without him saying it, Coltaine looks at him and says “we cannot.” Duiker silently agrees that this must end in blood. The air suddenly changes as the predicted “something” arrives: three massive carriages arriving out of Hood’s Warren. A mage steps out of the lead one and tell Coltaine his exploits are spoken of with wonder in Darujhistan and that people (“alchemists, mages, sorcerers”) have arranged with the Trygalle Trade Guild to supply the army with food and water.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>The mage, Karpolan Demesand, was one of the original founders of the TTG, an alliance of mages that came to “specialize in expeditions so risk-laden as to make the average merchant pale.” He tells them Hood’s warren is warped tight about Coltaine’s group. He tells them the Malazans that formerly were going to attack Darujhistan are now allies against the Pannion Seer and that Dujek sends his greetings and was the instigator of this resupply, helped by the cabal of mages in the city. Dujek told the Guild “The Empress cannot lose such leaders as Coltaine,” a sentiment Karpolan finds odd coming from an “outlaw.” Dujek also sent Coltaine, from Quick Ben, a strange bottle for Coltaine to wear at all times. When Coltaine at first refuses, Karpolan tells him it’s an order from Dujek and when Coltaine questions how he, a Malazan soldier, can be ordered by a Malazan outlaw, Karpolan says when he himself asked Dujek the same question, Dujek’s answer was “never underestimate the Empress.” Everyone there realizes the “outlawing” was faked so as to ally with Brood and Rake. Coltaine takes the bottle and Karpolan tells him to break it against his chest “when the time comes.” Karpolan then says he will not stay to witness the tragedy of tomorrow’s battle, plus he has an even more difficult delivery to make. He asks if Coltaine has anything to say to Dujek and Coltaine says simply “no.”</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>With the food and water, the army rises in the morning in better mood and shape. Coltaine prepares an attempt to punch through the tribes blocking the valley mouth leading toward Aren. List arrives saying he feels hope is in the air. The Khundryl, in tens of thousands, appear and send a small group, which the Malazan assume will be a personal combat challenge to Coltaine. When Duiker tells Coltaine it is madness, that Coltaine is acting like a Wickan and not a Fist, and that Quick Ben’s bottle will only work once, Coltaine rips it off and throws it at Duiker. The Khundryl war chiefs though are not here for combat. One tells them the Khundryl have long waited for this day to see which of the great tribes of the South Odhans is the most powerful and that Coltaine should watch what happens.</p><p>SCENE 12</p><p>As Coltaine’s army is giving ground to the Tregyn/Bhilard tribes on one side and Dom’s army on the other, the Khundryl suddenly attack all three. Dom’s army eventually pushes them back, though the tribes among it were shattered. Meanwhile, the Tregyn and Bhilard were routed. The same Khundryl warchief returns and asks if Coltaine noted which was the most powerful. Coltaine says the Khundryl and when the Khundryl chief says no, they lost to Dom, Coltaine says it must be Dom then whom the Khundryl recognize as most powerful. The war chief calls him a fool and says it’s “The Wickans! The Wickans! The Wickans!”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>As Ragstopper nears Malaz City Elan tries to convince Kalam to let him help Kalam kill Laseen. Kalam says he has no intention of trying to kill the Empress (Elan doesn’t buy it) and then asks Elan directly was sorcery working on the ship. Elan says they’re being tracked by someone who wants to ensure the cargo gets to where it’s going. Kalam tells Elan he’s supposed to make contact with friends outside the Deadhouse.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Pust, Mappo, and Crokus all try unsuccessfully to open Tremorlor’s door. The D’ivers bloodflies are heading for them. Icarium wakens and draws his sword. The Hounds and D’ivers reach the House’s yard together and the grounds erupt, reaching for both. Fiddler tries the door as Mappo attempts to hold back Icarium, but it will not open. Moby climbs down Fiddler’s arm and opens the door. They all enter the House with Icarium lapsing back into unconsciousness. Pust tells them the Hounds helped Tremorlor take the D’ivers then escaped themselves. They look down and see a long-dead corpse on the floor. When they wonder where Moby is Pust tells them he’s a Soletaken. Apsalar says the corpse is probably the last Keeper (every House has a Guardian) and Mappo identities it as a Forkrul Assail. Apsalar says the layout of Tremorlor is the same as the Deadhouse in Malaz City. Moby returns. Pust tells Mappo to let the Azath have Icarium while he’s unconscious, but Mappo refuses. The Trygalle Trade Guild appear out in the now-quiet yard, led by Karpolan Demesand, who tells them he’s there via Quick Ben. He delivers a box of munitions to Fiddler, then leaves.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Apsalar theorizes that Moby had thought he’d found the Path of Hands, had been drawn by the promise of Ascendancy, which was partly true as the Azath is in need of a new Guardian. Fiddler tells them they need to look for a portal which links all the Azath and Apsalar gives directions thanks to Cotillion’s memories. Moby leads them, passing a huge suit of armor he seems enamored of. The come across another body, this of a young woman, whom Apsalar identifies as Dassem Ultor’s daughter. She says Dassem recovered her after Hood “was done using her” (she’s described with “vicious wounds crisscross[ing] her slight form”) and brought here to the Azath before breaking his vow to Hood and cursing him. Apsalar says the portal is not far and when asked, both Mappo and Pust say they’ll join the group, though Mappo says he’ll probably exit at a different spot and Pust mumbles he’ll look for a chance of betrayal. They say goodbye to Moby and Crokus realizes Moby had been protecting them through the storms. When he worries Moby will be lonely, Apsalar says there are other Houses and other Guardians (all of them linked).</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>After they head for the portal, Moby goes back to the suit of armor, from which a voice tells him “I am pleased my solitude is at an end.“</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Duiker is in the midst of a counterattack against Korbolo Dom’s forces, who have been constantly and relentlessly raiding since the surprising attack on Dom by the Khundryl three days ago. The Chain, down to five thousand soldiers, is dropping like flies from the raids and from exhaustion. Lull and the unnamed female marine meet Duiker and tell him Coltaine wants him, that they’ve met another tribe who seem content to merely watch rather than attack. Lull asks what Duiker knows of the tribes in this area and Duiker responds that they have no love of Aren and that the Empire has treated them well, paying for passage and not asking for inordinate tribute. He can tell from Lull’s expression that Coltaine has come to some sort of decision and he worries what it is. The three realize what they continue to fight for is the children’s “dignity.”</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>As they come to the flat hill, they can see two old raised (15 arm-spans high) roads. The Crow Clan mans the raised road like a fortified wall. Coltaine tells Duiker he is sending him with Nile and Nether and a troop to meet the new tribe and try to buy passage to Aren. Lull tells Coltaine that the wounded, along with Corporal List, have refused to go with them. Coltaine tells Duiker to “deliver the refuges to Aren” and when Duiker mentions the possibility of betrayal, Coltaine says then they’ll all die together. Duiker offers the alchemical bottle delivered by the Trygalle Trade Guild but Coltaine refuses it, telling Duiker he, as historian—the teller of the tale—is more important. And that he should tell Dujek, if he sees him, that it “is not the Empire’s soldiers the Empress cannot afford to lose, it is its memory.” Lull tells Duiker that List sent his goodbyes and wanted to let Duiker know he has “found my war.” Coltaine prepares to attack. The unnamed female marine gives Duiker a piece of cloth and tells him not to read what’s on it for a while.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Duiker leads the refugees out then takes Nether with him to meet two elders of the new tribe. He tells them Coltaine is offering a “collection from all the soldiers of the Seventh . . . forty-one thousand silver jakatas.” The tribal elder identifies that number as the annual wages of a full Malazan army and scorns Duiker for stealing the soldiers’ wages to buy passage. Duiker tells her the soldiers in fact insisted; it was a true collection. Nether adds more from the Wickans: all that they looted on the long journey, all that they have (and, it is implied, all they will have no use for when they die). The elders say it is too much, more than the treaties specify, and agree to take the remainder to escort the refugees to the Aren Road as well as feed and heal them.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>As dusk falls over the refugees, Duiker listens to their slow realization that they are being cared for, their tortured response to the kindness of the Kherahn tribe, even the possibility they may in fact make it to Aren, and that it comes at the cost of those sacrificing themselves in battle against Dom. Nether tells Duiker she can no longer speak to Coltaine. When he asks if it means Coltaine is dead, she says they would probably sense his death cry. She says she fears they will not make it, as it’s still going to be three leagues to Aren from the Aren Road to which the Kherahn will escort them. Nethpara arrives and tells Duiker some of the well off have purchased fresh horses and wish to leave now for Aren. They also mention that Tumlit “fell ill” and died. Duiker refuses them freedom to leave, worried it will cause panic. Nethpara starts to challenge Duiker to a duel and Duiker knocks him unconscious with the flat of his sword.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>After a day and night’s march, they arrive at the start of the Aren Way, a raised road with ditches to either side and cedars lining the tops of the banks on its 10-mile path to Aren. The Kherahn elder tells Duiker a large force is swiftly approaching and then asks if he’s sure Aren will open its gates to the refugees if they even make it. Duiker laughs and says basically we’ll see.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>They march past huge mass graves from when the T’lan Imass slaughtered the residents of Aren earlier. They can see the pursuing army behind, opting for the shorter cross-country path rather than the road itself. Duiker guesses the barrows, which will slow their pursuers, are too new to be on maps and this may just give the refugees the extra time they need. Nil, who has been sent ahead, sends to Nether that they can see the city and its gates are shut. Dom’s army seems to be coming slower than it should be. The first refugees are within a thousand paces of the city and its gates remain shut. Duiker orders Nether to ride ahead with the Wickans. Duiker passes refugees simply stopping and giving up. He scoops up an eighteen-month old and continues on. Aren has finally opened the gates and the refugees are streaming in, helped by the Aren City Garrison. Pormqual’s army, however, simply watches from the walls. Duiker hands the child to a garrison soldier—Captain Keneb—who tells Duiker he’s to report to the High Fist immediately. He also tells him the soldiers on the wall have been ordered by Pormqual to do nothing and they aren’t happy.</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>Duiker looks back and sees the refugees who had given up, unable to move and too far for him to retrieve (and it’s clear the Fist won’t let his soldiers out of the city). He looks north to see a dust cloud over the nearest barrow, then the high pillar of the Whirlwind. He enters the city.</p><p>SCENE 12</p><p>Apt and the boy Panek are in Shadow. Cotillion joins them and tells Apt her reshaping of the boy will scar him inside. She replies and he tells her he [Panek] “now belongs to neither.” When she speaks again he smiles and calls her presumptuous, then introduces himself to Panek as “Uncle Cotillion.” Panek says he can’t be related because his eyes are different and that Cotillion had walked through walls and trees of “the ghost world as if ignorant of its right to dwell here.” Cotillion asks Apt if Panek is insane and is shocked at her answer. He then asks what Panek recalls of his other world and Panek says he remembers being told to stay close to Father, then being led away by soldiers who then punished him and all the children for not “doing what we were told” by nailing them to crosses. Cotillion gets icy then tells Panek he wasn’t hurt for not doing what he was told but because nobody could stop those people, that Panek’s father would have but was helpless. And that Apt and Cotillion will make sure Panek is never helpless again. Then he says he and Panek will teach each other: Panek can teach Cotillion what he sees in the ghost world, the “Shadow Hold that was, the old places that remain.” Panek says he’d like that, as well as meeting the Hounds (“cuddly mutts”) Cotillion mentions. Cotillion tells Apt she was right, she can’t do it alone and he and Shadowthrone will think about it. He says Apt has to leave, she has debts to pay, and asks if Panek would rather go with her or join Cotillion in settling the other children. Panek answers he’ll go with mother to help the man from before (Kalam), who dreams of the sight of Panek on the cross. Cotillion says that doesn’t surprise him, that Kalam, like Cotillion, is “haunted by helplessness.” He turns to Apt and says when he Ascended, he had hoped to “escape the nightmares of feeling . . . imagine my surprise that I now thank you for such chains.” Panek ask Cotillion if he has any children and Cotillion says he had a daughter “of sorts” though they’ve had a falling-out (Laseen). Panek says Cotillion has to forgive her and Cotillion replies the forgiveness should actually go the other way.</p><p>SCENE 13</p><p>Ragstopper enters Malaz Harbor just before midnight. Kalam can see a pennant flying above Mock’s Hold and realizes someone important is here. Kalam is beginning to think the Deadhouse is a possible escape route of last resort if things go wrong here. The crew is strangely asleep aboard ship and he starts to realize he has seemingly lost his will and control over his body. Elan appears beside him and tells Kalam his mind now betrays him. He continues, introducing himself as Pearl and saying Kalam is a legend among the Claw, and that Kalam would have been head of the Claw had he not left, no matter what Topper thinks. He informs Kalam that the Red Blades assassinated Sha’ik shortly after Kalam delivered the book. Pearl/Elan says the Empress is here to have a conversation with Kalam but the Claw takes care of its own business. He then stabs Kalam to weaken him and warns him three Hands wait in the city for him, ready to start the hunt, before tossing him overboard. His last words to Kalam are it’s a shame that Pearl has to now kill the captain and crew. Apt suddenly appears with Panek on her shoulders and strikes Pearl. He conjures an Imperial demon then leaves.</p><p>SCENE 14</p><p>The captain wakes and finds the sailors watching two demons fighting on deck. He orders the First Mate to get the dories ready to abandon ship and the First Mate calls him “Carther,” which the captain answers with “shut your face . . . I drowned years ago, remember?”</p><p>SCENE 15</p><p>On the trader that had been keeping pace with Ragstopper, the captain and First Mate comment that the Ragstopper is about to go down and get ready to help rescue people. Minala appears on deck atop Kalam’s stallion and jumps the horse into the harbor. The Captain, impressed by both her bravery and stupidity, orders the ship’s mage to clear her a path through the sharks and anything else ahead of her.</p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-One</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Felisin/Sha’ik looks down on the city from a watchtower, alongside the young girl she adopted. Heboric joins her and tells her L’oric is the “one to watch,” that he seems to sense that Felisin has made a bargain with the goddess rather than acceding to letting the goddess be fully reborn (Heboric says instead the goddess has been “remade”). Heboric asks Felisin when the goddess first turned her eyes to her, when she began the manipulations that would lead to this point and Felisin says she never did—that all the twists and turns of mortality (deaths, decisions) makes things too complex for the goddess to manipulate. Sha’ik Elder did have prophecies and visions, but they made little sense to Dryjhna and were too uncertain, not to mention that the goddess isn’t much for strategy. Heboric answers then that if not Dryjhna, someone/something must have guided Felisin as Sha’ik never would have had those visions, and he wonders if even gods are pieces on a board, as mortals are. Felisin replies with a quote from Kellanved: “Elemental forces in opposition”, words meant, she says, to “justify the balance of destruction with creation—the expansion of the Empire.” When Heboric asks what she’ll do about Dom’s atrocities in her name, she corrects him with “in the name of the goddess” and says Dom remains “unfettered” and so “free to answer his obsessions.” Heboric says it’ll take months to march to meet him and by then Dom will have done so much that Tavore will be more than justified in whatever harsh retribution she brings down on Seven Cities. Felisin says she’ll have the advantage over Tavore, as her sister will expect to face merely an ignorant desert witch, not someone who knows so much of Tavore’s mind. Besides, she says, as the Whirlwind lowers itself horizontal, it won’t take months—the Whirlwind is the goddess’ Warren and will take them South.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Duiker and Nether go to the tower where Mallick Rel and Pormqual stand looking down, along with Nil and an unknown commander barely in control of himself. The soldiers on the walls are screaming in rage and outrage as they see Coltaine, with fewer than 400 soldiers left, still fighting his way toward Aren and being slaughtered by Dom’s thousands, close enough that Duiker can see individuals clearly. Duiker reaches for Pormqual but is held back by the Garrison Commander as Pormqual says there are too many. Duiker says a sortie would save them, to which the garrison commander replies Duiker is right but the Fist won’t allow it. Duiker turns and watches Bult die, then Corporal List, watches as a massive cattle dog, pinioned with arrows, tries to defend Coltaine and gets speared, then sees Coltaine being nailed to a cross as thousands of crows darken the sky. Kamist Reloe uses sorcery to kill the crows, refusing to allow them access to Coltaine’s soul. The garrison commander calls for Squint, his best archer and orders him to kill the man on the cross. As he aims, Squint realizes it’s Coltaine and then, weeping, kills him. The crows swoop down on Coltaine, Reloe’s sorcery shunted aside, and when the crows fly off Coltaine is gone. Duiker holds the archer, who appears to have broken by what he did. Duiker watches Pormqual grow more fearful as he gazes at Dom’s army and “shrinks into Mallick Rel’s shadow.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Two</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Kalam pulls himself out of the water into Malaz City. He takes the attack to the Hands waiting for him and kills a bunch of them.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Fiddler’s group moves through the Azath. Rellock realizes they are walking on a map. Fiddler realizes the floor, which stretches out for leagues in all directions, is a map/way to all the worlds, to every House. Pust disappears. They find a hole where he went and as they pass on, thinking Pust had fallen to his death, the floor reforms.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Mappo walks on feeling guilt over his cowardice, his selfishness, his breaking of his vows by not giving Icarium over to the Azath.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Apsalar sees Mappo and Icarium disappear into another hole. The rest rope themselves together. They see three dragons fly by then dive into the tiles and disappear. They realize you go through when you get to where you’re going, even, as Fiddler thinks, “you don’t exactly plan on it.” They realize the others aren’t dead. The appearance of the dragons, their indifference, and the scale of the Azath leads Fiddler to muse on how small they were, and how the world goes on without them.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Aren prepares for Dom’s siege. Tension is in the air as the soldiers are angry at Pormqual for not letting them out to try and save Coltaine. Tavore’s fleet is less than a week away. Blistig tells Duiker Mallick Rel has convinced Pormqual to ride out and attack Dom and also that Nethpara is blaming Coltaine for the deaths of so many refugees. Blistig says his guard has been ordered to be rear guard and the Red Blades have been arrested. Duiker and Blistig agree it makes more sense to wait for Tavore and let Dom batter himself against Aren. Pormqual commands Duiker to join them to see how battle is done and then he and Nil and Nether will be arrested for treason. Nethpara starts to mock Duiker and Duiker kills him. Keneb arrives and when he hears Duiker refer to Mallick Rel as “Jhistal,” he recalls what Kalam had said to him and steps back to find Blistig. He runs.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Dom’s army appears to flee before Pormqual’s. Then, Aren’s army rides into an ambush; they are encircled by vast numbers. Rel says it is Duiker’s treachery and that he smells sorcery on Duiker, whom he accuses of being in communication with Dom. Dom approaches under parley flag and Rel goes to meet them. Duiker tries to convince Pormqual to punch through and withdraw to the city to no avail. Rel returns and says Dom says the army must lay down arms and group in the basin, then they’ll be treated as prisoners of war, while Rel and Pormqual will be hostages. Duiker, seeing what is coming, lets his horse go as “the least I can do for her.” Rel convinces Pormqual to accede and Pormqual orders his commanders to do so. The captains salute and go to give the order.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>The army disarms and groups. Dom and Reloe arrive. Rel says he has delivered the city to Dom. Duiker laughs and says not true; Blistig and his command stayed behind and probably freed the Red Blades as well. They are few but enough to hold the walls until Tavore shows up. Dom says Duiker will die with the other soldiers, that he will make Tavore too furious to think. Dom wants to kill Squint (he doesn’t know the name) special but he’s disappeared. He has Pormqual killed, rather than give him the honor of dying with his soldiers.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Dom spends a day and a half crucifying all the soldiers (10,000) on the cedars along Aren Way. Duiker was last. As he dies, a “ghostly, tusked face rose before his mind’s eye . . . The gravest compassion filled that creature’s unhuman eyes.” The face disappears as “awareness ceased.”</p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Three</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Kalam continues fighting Claws. He’s seemingly about to be killed but is saved by Minala. They head for Mock’s Hold.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Fiddler and the others fall through and find themselves in the Deadhouse in Malaz City. Inside they meet a Guardian—Gothos—and he reveals Icarium is his son. He also bemoans that Icarium wasn’t taken and reveals that Mappo had been lied to about Icarium destroying his village—that the Nameless Ones had done it to get a companion because Icarium’s last one had killed himself. When Fiddler asked why Icarium is so cursed, Gothos says he wounded a warren to try and free Gothos from the Azath and was damaged. Fiddler thanks the gods for mortality, thinking he couldn’t live with such long-lived torment. Gothos directs them to a bucket of healing water on their way out. Apsalar senses Claw sorcery on the air. Fiddler says they should aim for Smiley’s tavern. Panek and Apt rise up as they exit the grounds and tells them Kalam is going to Mock’s Hold to see the Empress and they offer to take them through Shadow.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>As Minala and Kalam ride the stallion up the stairs of Mock’s Hold, they enter a warren which takes them inside. Minala stays back and Kalam enters a room to have an audience with Laseen. She asks why he’s come to kill her. He lists: killing the Bridgeburners deliberately, outlawing Dujek, trying to kill Whiskeyjack and the Ninth, old disappearances (Old Guard), maybe killing Dassem Ultor, killing Dancer and Kellanved, incompetence, betrayal. Laseen requests and is granted a defense. She says: Tayschrenn’s “efforts in Genabackis were misguided,” she didn’t plan or want to kill the Bridgeburners, Lorn was sent to kill Sorry, Dujek’s outlawing was a ruse. She admits to killing Dancer and Kellanved and usurping the throne in betrayal saying the Empire, which is greater than any individual, required it. She followed what she saw as necessity, though admits to some “grievous errors in judgment.” On Dassem, she answers he was ambitious and sworn to Hood and she struck first to avoid civil war. When Kalam asks about Seven Cities she says it will be repaid in kind and her anger convinces Kalam. He calls her Empress and turns away (he’s also been aware for some time she isn’t actually physically present). She warns him she can’t call off the Claw and asks where he’ll go when he escapes them. Kalam and Minala head out.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Topper and Laseen converse. She says Kalam is no longer a threat, and knows he’d realized she wasn’t really there. She tells Topper she doesn’t want to lose Kalam and he says he can’t call off the Claw but she’s crazy if she thinks they’ll kill Kalam. He tells her to consider it an overdue winnowing. Topper says he’s angry with Pearl and Laseen says discipline him but not too much.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Four Hands appear and then Apt and Fiddler’s group arrives to help. They all end up in shadows. Kalam tells Fiddler he changed his mind about killing Laseen. Shadowthrone arrives and tells them they’re in Shadowrealm and Apt has delivered them to him. Apt yells at him. Shadowthrone says he’ll reward them all. Apsalar, her father, and Crokus ask to be sent to the Kanese coast (where Cotillion first possessed her—her home) and they disappear. Kalam says he and Minala could do with a rest and Shadowthrone says he knows just the place, and Apt will be with them. Fiddler says he’s going to re-enlist and go join Tavore. Shadowthrone sends him to behind Smileys. Shadowthrone takes Kalam and Minala to where the 1300 children saved from crucifixion are.</p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Four</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Sha’ik and her army enter onto the Aren plains from the Whirlwind warren. Her three mages and Heboric can sense death ahead of such fashion or on such scale that all “flinch.” Heboric asks Sha’ik if she regrets her choices and she thinks of the argument she had with her sister when she accused Tavore of killing their parents, though her answer to Heboric is “I have a daughter now.” She tells Heboric her daughter has a gift with words, a “poet’s eye,” such as Felisin herself might have had had she been given the freedom. Heboric warns such a gift might instead be a curse for Felisin Younger, saying those who “invite awe” can be very lonely, “lonely in themselves.” Sha’ik assures him she won’t be lonely and says she understands remoteness. When he asks if she’s named her Felisin, she says yes, the name “holds such promise. A fresh innocence such as that which parents would see in their child.” Heboric weeps as he listens and when she tells him “Oh Heboric, it’s not worthy of grief,” it crushes him. Leoman, Rel, Reloe, and Dom arrive. Sha’ik sees what Dom has done and scouts report that the crucifixions number in the thousands and line the road for at least three leagues. Dom admits he could not take Aren and that Tavore’s fleet has entered the bay. He marvels that the army surrendered as Pormqual ordered and says it shows the Empire’s weakness—its lack of great leaders. He says Coltaine was the last and Tavore is untested, noble, outnumbered, and lacks advisors. Sha’ik orders the corpses on the plain (not the crucified ones) buried and then a return to Raraku to await Tavore’s army on her terms (though her interior thoughts reveal her terror at the thought). Heboric asks which crucified body he stands before, if anyone knows who the body is. Rel says it’s “an old man. . . A soldier, no more than that.” Heboric asks if anyone else hears a god’s laughter.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Heboric, last to leave, still stares at the corpse, still hearing laughter in his head, and wonders why is he blind: is it cruel joke or mercy Is it Fener or the jade He tells Fener he wishes “to come home.”</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Blistig waits to greet Tavore. Keneb arrives and said he had no luck finding Stormy and Gesler or Squint, and that the 7th army is ready to be inspected. Blistig worries Squint will commit suicide. Keneb tells Blistig the survivors of the Chain are broken and Blistig agrees, thinking his own company is “brittle.”</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Mappo lays the still-unconscious Icarium down for a rest; he and Icarium were spit out along the Aren Way and Mappo has been futilely trying to find a spot “free of death.” He watches as a cart with three men stop at every tree to examine the bodies nailed to them, then move on to the next. Mappo goes to meet the cart—Stormy, Gesler, and Truth—and when they mention need of bandages he offers his skill at healing. They tell him it’s a pair of dogs, not people, who are wounded and that they’d found them at Coltaine’s Fall. Mappo says it appears they are looking for someone among the bodies and Gesler says yes, and when Mappo asks how many bodies there are and that they’ve checked, Gesler tells him 10,000 and they’ve checked them all—these at the Aren Gate are the last few. Mappo says he’ll look at the dogs and is shocked at their condition and that they still live. Truth is utterly distraught. Mappo worries that when Icarium wakes he’ll wonder at the grief Mappo will still be carrying. He is sad that Icarium loses his memories not only of death and horror but also memories of “gifts given so freely,” and wonders how Icarium would answer all this death. Stormy, who has been checking bodies, yells to Gesler to join him at once. They return to the cart and when Stormy asks if they found him, they tell him no, it wasn’t him. Truth is relieved that at least there is a chance their goal is alive then. Mappo, looking at Gesler, knows he’s not telling the truth for Truth’s sake. Mappo turns down an offer for a ride then, after they head back toward Aren a bit, jogs after them, rummaging in his pack.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Pust, walking down the path toward the temple, suddenly starts tearing at his clothes as spiders drop from them. The spider D’ivers assemble into a Dal Honese woman named Mogora, who tells him she’s been watching him for months—saw him lay the false trails, etc. When he tells her she’ll never find the real Path of Hands she answers she doesn’t want to: “I escaped Dol Hon to be rid of idiots. Why would I become Ascendant just to rule over other idiots” They walk off together.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>A dragon rises before them and disappears into a warren.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Pust says the dragon was there to guard the real gate, and identifies the dragon as a T’lan Imass Bonecaster. He and Mogora prepare to enter the temple together.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>A large ornate wagon is halted at the Aren Gate and two creatures that look like bhok’arala disembark and head to a tree. The two are named Irp and Rudd and their dialogue makes clear they are on a mission from Baruk. Rudd climbs onto a corpse nailed to the last tree and searches under its shirt. He pulls out a piece of cloth with the name “Sa’yless Lorthal” written on it then pulls out a small bottle. Rudd says “it broke all right” and then, examining it, says “he’s in there all right.” They start to take the body down to bring back with them to Baruk in Darujhistan.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Icarium wakes and notices he’s injured. Mappo says he gave away his last two healing elixirs to heal some dogs. Icarium says they must have been “worthy beasts” and he looks forward to hearing that story. The last thing he recalls is spotting the aptorian demon (back at the start of the book). Mappo says that were cast out from a warren and Icarium hit his head on a rock, and it’s been just a day. They head off into the Jhag Odan plain as Icarium wonders aloud what he’d do without Mappo.</p><p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p><p>A young pregnant Wickan widow walks into the grassland near her camp. She been told by the horsewife that the child within her had no soul, it has been cursed, and so she is about to drink a potion to abort the child. Suddenly, the horsewife appears to stop her. The two watch an approaching storm that turns out to be a cloud of crows heading their way. Inside her belly, “the child stirred.”</p><p><strong>Prologue</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Set during the 33rd Jaghut War. Pran Chole (whom we saw in Silverfox’s birth in GotM) is looking at a scene preserved in ice: three extinct ranag trapped in a sinkhole—a male, mate and calf—along with six extinct Ay (huge wolves), though a young Ay seems to have escaped only to die, Pran thinks, in solitude. Pran Chole is joined by another Imass—Cannig Tol—and the two discuss how the Imass hunted creatures to extinction, and how they can see themselves and their war with the Jaghut in the scene before them. We then learn they are tracking Jaghut and are close. Pran senses another Bonecaster nearby, traveling alone.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>The Jaghut mother being pursued is exhausted and wounded and knows she and her son and daughter will be killed soon. She thinks they are the last Jaghut on this continent and recalls how she and other Jaghut allied with the Imass to chain the Tyrant Raest, knowing the Imass would turn on them immediately afterward. She is surprised by the Bonecaster Pran sensed, who offers the Jaghut mother a bargain: leave the mother for Pran’s group but the Bonecaster will save the children.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>The Bonecaster takes the boy and girl to a tower with a warren’s damaged gate high up in the air. She assumes it is Omtose Phellack (Jaghut warren) due to its proximity to the tower, which seems Jaghut in nature. She plans to send them through to save them.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Pran Chole’s group finds the Jaghut mother, without her children. She tells him the other Bonecaster took her children to a gate in the south. The Imass kill her. Pran tells Cannig they must head south quickly as the other Bonecaster is about to send the children through the Rent at Morn, incorrectly believing it to be Omtose Phellack. Cannig tells Pran to go quickly for “we are not cruel.”</p><p>SCENE 5<br/>The renegade Bonecaster sends the children through. Pran appears and she identifies herself as Kilava of the Logros clan. Pran tells her the Jaghut tower was atop the ruins of an ancient city and it was the Rent that destroyed the city. He asks Kilava how such wounds are sealed and she says if a soul had sealed it, her sending the children in would free it and put the children in its place. He challenged her to sacrifice herself to save the children, knowing she will not. Looking at a large mound on the plain, he tells her the prior soul has arrived, though it will have to free itself of the tomb and dig out from under the lava flow, meaning they have time to deal with it. He adds they’ll have lots of time, as the First Gathering has been called to perform the Ritual of Tellann. Kilava says they’re all insane to make themselves immortal to fight a war and declares she will defy the call. He tells her he has spiritwalked far into the future and has seen his T’lan Imass self. She says her brother will be pleased: Onos T’oolan, the First Sword. At his name, Pran identifies just who she is; she is the one who slaughtered her clan and kin save for Tool. She says she did it to “break the link and thus achieve freedom.” She asks Pran who built the ancient city and he answers K’Chain Che’Malle. When Kilava says she knows almost nothing of them, Pran says he’s pretty sure they’ll learn.</p><p>SCENE 6<br/>Set three years after the Fall of the Crippled God on the Korelri and Jacuruku continents. The Fall had destroyed an entire continent with firestorms for months, the fallen god screaming in pain the whole time, the pain eventually turning to rage then poison. K’rul walks the continent among the few survivors, feeding on the blood from the Fall and from the killings in his wake, thinking this power will be needed.</p><p>SCENE 7<br/>The Crippled God had broken into pieces. K’rul had seen some of the pieces and the maggots crawling from them and then turning into Great Ravens. He thinks it will be long before the Crippled God could reclaim the fragments and show its true nature and K’rul worries it will be insane from the shattering. The summoners of the god had opened a portal through chaos to an alien world and pulled the god down for power to try and destroy Kallor. K’rul had come here to destroy Kallor who had ruled with such “heartless mastery,” worse even than a Jaghut tyrant. He was to be joined by two other Elder Gods whom he now senses nearing. He senses as well a one-eyed beast following, wounded by the Fall. A beast that has roamed this land long before Kallor’s Empire rose. As K’rul walks across Jacuruku, he sees no life, just ash. The other two gods—Draconus and Sister of Cold Night— approaching from other directions, tell him they are finding the same. The three meet Kallor, sitting on his throne atop a hill of bones. They tell him they came to end his “reign of terror” and he tells them he conquered the continent in only 50 years, save for Ar-datha who has fled. He then says they will not be able to liberate his people as he has killed them all, incinerating the entire continent. K’rul tells the others he will “fashion a place for this. Within myself”—another warren [the Imperial Warren]. Draconus and Sister are appalled at the cost to K’rul. The three curse Kallor to: “know mortal life unending. Mortal in the ravages of age, in the pain of wounds . . . dreams brought to ruin. In love withered . . . you shall never ascend . . . each time you rise, you shall then fall. All that you achieve shall turn to dust in your hands.” In turn, Kallor, using the power of all the death he caused, curses them: “K’rul you shall fade from the world [and] be forgotten. Draconus, what you create shall be turned upon you. And as for you woman, unhuman hands shall tear your body into pieces upon a field of battle, yet you shall know no respite.”</p><p>SCENE 8<br/>They create the warren to hold the destruction so the land might heal. K’rul is nearly broken by it, wounded for all time, and he can already feel his worship dwindling. Draconus mentions he has been forging a sword since “the time of All Darkness,” a sword that “possesses a finality.” K’rul suggests he change the sword before finishing it and Draconus agrees. Sister says she won’t live her life worrying about the curse and her destruction will come from betrayal. The others advise she be careful whom she chooses to fight for and also finds herself a companion.</p><p>SCENE 9<br/>The one-eyed beast, identified as more ancient than the Elder Gods, watches the Elder Gods depart. It has lost its mate and will seek it. It heads into its own warren.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p><p>SCENE 1<br/>Gruntle, leader of a caravan guard group (Harllo, Stonny Menackis), waits at the crowded ford outside Darujhistan to take his master’s (Keruli) carriage across. He is hailed by Emancipator Reese, who says his masters in another waiting carriage want to speak to him.</p><p>SCENE 2<br/>Gruntle meets Bauchelain and feels immediately uneasy. Bauchelain tells Gruntle that Keruli’s “prying is none too subtle” and this time they’re making an exception to such invasion of privacy. He leads Gruntle to a fresh crater and introduces him to his partner Korbal Breach, who scares Gruntle even more than Bauchelain did. Bauchelain tells Gruntle the crater was a prison for a Jaghut Tyrant, freed by a T’lan Imass and a representative of the Malazan Empire, and mentions a few rumors that basically recap some highlights of GotM. He then says they’re going to explore the tomb and asks if Gruntle wants to join them, saying his master would probably urge him to accept. Gruntle refuses, then points out Moon’s Spawn in the distance moving away. When Bauchelain mentions the tilt, he’s impressed when Gruntle says that was caused by the Malazan mages. Broach seems a bit nervous at the idea that Rake may sense them, but Bauchelain reassures him he senses no such thing. When the pair head into the tomb, Gruntle heads back, wishing Rake had sensed the two and done something about them.</p><p>SCENE 3<br/>The one-eyed beast from the prologue (identified now as a wolf), has found a human body in the Warren of Chaos and while it hesitates over possibilities is pleasantly shocked by noting the human’s face is “mirrored” to its own, making its decision easier.</p><p>SCENE 4<br/>Toc the Younger (one-eyed) awakens on a field with barrows, remembering the ambush by Hairlock and being thrown into a warren. He can tell by the condition of his bow it was a long time ago. He notes one has been holed. Atop the central barrow, he can see the ruins of a stone tower with a “welt in the sky beyond the tower.” Looking at the barrow, he sees something made its way out of it. As he heads for the tower, he stumbles across Tool who briefly recounts some of what happened in GotM and tells Toc they are in Morn and that the woman who lives in the tower has returned. He says he will help Toc with food and arrows. The woman approaches, flanked by Gareth—a large dog—and Baaljagg, an Ay, which shocks Tool. Tool identifies the woman as Lady Envy, daughter of Draconus (killed by Rake with Dragnipur, forged by Draconus) and sister to Spite. Tool wants to know what she’s doing in Morn. Inside the tower are three masked Seguleh. Toc says that for the Seguleh “rank is everything. If the hierarchy’s in doubt, challenge it” and that only the lowest ranked will speak with non-Seguleh. One of the Seguleh has only two slashes on it. Senu challenged Tool and is quickly knocked unconscious, even before he can fully draw his swords. Tool asks Envy what she knows of the Rent and she says it has been bridged by a mortal soul and it seems “almost mechanical.” She adds the K’Chain Che’Malle barrows have been empty for decades and one contained a Matron. She believes the Matron was the one originally sealing the Rent and she has been replaced. Tool says if she wants to know more, she should go with him, for he follows an ancient trail that will lead to her answers. He also tells her that her “old travelling companions”—Rake and Brood—are heading the same way, toward the Pannion Domin to fight against the Domin. Envy says she will accompany Tool and Toc north.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Two</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Picker’s squad stops Munug, an artisan/trader at a checkpoint. Picker buys a trio of ivory torcs that according to the artisan had received a blessing from Treach, the Tiger of Summer. Picker says Treach was a First Hero (a demigod, Soletaken ascendant) not a god, but the trader says a new temple has been sanctified in his name. The ivory comes from a “furred, tusked monster” that was Treach’s favorite prey—it was found in frozen mud. When she puts them on, they click.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Munug thinks how he has tumors between his legs and that the Crippled God has chosen him for those “flaws” along with his skills. He enters a warren gate and comes out on a plain with a smoky tent. Munug hands the CG in the tent a deck of cards, each with a flaw. As “payment,” the CG heals the tumors but Munug’s legs are dead as the price of the cure, as “perfection is anathema” to the CG.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Picker and Blend discuss how they put a magical “beacon” on Munug so Quick Ben can track him, as he was clearly carrying something.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Quick Ben arrives via Black Moranth flight. He immediately notes the torcs and tells Picker she’s “acquired the blessing of an ascendant.” Upon learning they belong to Treach, he tells them Treach lost himself in his Soletaken form hundreds of years ago. He says he’ll take a look at where his tracker went and Picker mournfully thinks how they’re off to another war, this one against the Pannion Domin.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Quick makes it clear via internal monologue that he knows Dujek’s host isn’t actually outlawed. He follows his beacon to the Crippled God’s tent. He learns that the CG is poisoning Burn and that the CG wants Quick to do something in payment for the CG returning his beacon, that the CG believes the gods and their world must suffer as he has. Before he can continue, Quick unleashes his power, grabs his beacon, and runs. He starts getting pulled back by the CG’s power, but a huge hand reaches up from the earth and pulls Ben down into a huge cavern where stand several such giants, arms holding up the cavern’s ceiling and what appears to be giant ribs in it. Quick realizes he is “within Burn, the Sleeping Goddess. A living warren.” One of the giants asks Quick for help, tells him that Burn is dying. Quick asks how long and the giant says “tens of years.” Quick leaves his beacon there so he can find his way back and vows to return with help, though it’s too late for that giant.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Picker tells Quick it’s time to go. The look he gives her scares her so much, she says, that she’s “ready to piss ice-cubes.” The last line tells us Quick remembered those words.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Paran has been sick at his stomach, had nightmares and visions, is in lots of pain, imagines some of it at least is a child’s, some of it the Hound’s blood in him. He wonders why Dujek and Whiskeyjack feel the need to take on the Pannion Domin. He tells himself not to think about the Empire, better to trust in Tavore.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Hedge tells Trotts Dujek wants the Bridgeburners back in Pale. They’re having a parley with Brood soon.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Mallet (the healer) tells Whiskeyjack that leg of his needs “serious attention” but WJ puts him off. Paran is given command of the 38 remaining Bridgeburners. He thinks of how he heard Tattersail’s voice meaning she was somehow alive. His internal monologue mentions his pain and “a child screaming in darkness, a Hound howling lost in sorrow, a soul nailed to the heart of a wound.”</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>Mallet tells Whiskeyjack that Paran is in worse shape than WJ and that Mallet’s Denul (healing) warren “recoiled.” He says Paran has sorcery running through him and Paran is fighting it and that’s what’s killing him. He and WJ agree to have Quick Ben take a look at him. Mallet tries again to get WJ to let him heal his leg but WJ says later.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Three</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>The Mhybe (Silverfox’s mother) is old and feeling the energy Silverfox (looking about 10-11) is drawing from her, aging the Mhybe unnaturally, though she believes Silverfox does not know this. Korlat arrives and she and the Mhybe discuss how Kallor continues to argue against Silverfox, though Korlat says Brood remains steadfast. The Mhybe worries that this is only because he needs the Rhivi and will end once he allies with the Malazans. Korlat says they hope the Malazans will know more of Silverfox’s origin, but the Mhybe says though she has the souls of two Malazans and the body of a Rhivi, she is in truth a Bonecaster Soletaken, born in Tellann warren wove by an Imass bonecaster. She wonders why the T’lan Imass need a flesh and blood Bonecaster. When Korlat points out the T’lan marched under the banners of the Malazan Empire, the Mhybe answer they no longer do and wonders why and what hidden motives the Malazans may have. Korlat says Brood is probably aware of such questions and invites the Mhybe to the parley. The Mhybe thinks of how the Malazans and Moranth bombed the Rhivi land, killed the sacred herds, and yet now they are asked to ally with them, and not even in the name of peace but for yet another war. She looks and sees the Malazans moving their way. Silverfox joins the Mhybe and Korlat and says she is sad because she can sense that the “sacred trust” between the land and the Rhivi spirits has been broken and the Rhivi spirits are “naught but untethered vessels of loss and pain.” The Mhybe asks if anything can be done and Silverfox says it no longer is necessary.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Silverfox tells the Mhybe that while her memories keep her fighting against the Malazans as the enemy, memories should tell her something else and that Korlat can explain. Korlat says the experiences are the same “across the breadth of time. Among all who possess memories, whether an individual or a people, life’s lessons are ever the same lessons.” Silverfox says to think on forgiveness through what’s to come, but know that “it must not always be freely given . . . Sometimes forgiveness must be denied.” The Malazans join them: Dujek, Whiskeyjack, Artanthos the standard bearer, and Twist the Black Moranth. When the Mhybe asks who the man next to Dujek is, Korlat guesses Whiskeyjack and says he “cuts quite a figure.” Silverfox says she thinks he’d be a good uncle; she trusts him. Twist she says always laughs inside—a laugh of “sorrow”—while she is and “always has been” “uncertain” of Artanthos. Caladan Brood and Kallor join the parley. The Mhybe thinks that Kallor hates Silverfox and seems to know something about her nobody else does, something that makes him fear her. She wonders at his claims to have lived for millennia and destroyed his own empire, and muses he can’t be an ascendant as his face and body show the ravages of time—at least a century. He looks with contempt at the Malazans. When Dujek introduces Artanthos, Silverfox thinks he hasn’t used that name for some time and also that he isn’t “as he appears.” Dujek asks Brood where the Crimson Guard is and Brood says they are attending to “internal matters” and will not be involved in the Pannion war. Dujek and Brood appear to take an instant liking to each other. Korlat marvels at the ease they put away prior to battle and the Mhybe says “pragmatic soldiers are the most frightening.”</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>As she passes by some Tiste Andii, the Mhybe thinks of their inherent strangeness: “a people plagued by indifference . . . secret tragedies in [their] long tortured past. Wounds that would never heal. Even suffering . . . was capable of becoming a way of life. To then extend such an existence from decades into centuries, then into millennia, still brought home . . . a dull shock of horror.” She thinks of them as ghosts, always waiting. As she sees Crone, she wonders at the relationship between Brood and Rake and of Crone as the “bridge between the two.” Silverfox greets Crone and says she had not “before realized that your kind were born in the rotting flesh of a—” and is quickly interrupted by Crone who says it is a secret. Crone tells Silverfox to be careful of what she reveals of herself, that she and the Mhybe will need protection. Inside the parley tent, Whiskeyjack laughs to see the large map table, which had been made by Fiddler and Hedge for a card game using a Deck of Dragons and then stolen by the Mott Irregulars. Silverfox examines the table then asks if Fiddler and Hedge cheated. Whiskeyjack says he doesn’t know, but the coins did flow one way only. The way he looks at her shows he senses something familiar about her but doesn’t know what it is.</p><p>Brood says the Pannnion’s forces are preparing to lay siege to Capustan, which is ruled by two warring factions: Prince Jelarkan and the Mask Council—a group of High Priests. The prince has hired the Grey Swords from Elingarth as a mercenary company to help protect the city while the priests have each temple’s private company of soldiers. Brood informs them that the peasant army of the Pannion—the Tenescowri—is not supplied by the Pannion Seer and so they eat the enemy. As Dujek talks strategy Crone and Mhybe laugh at how much he sounds like Brood. Whiskeyjack says they need to make contact with the Prince. Silverfox says he and Dujek have already set up to do so as they plan on liberating Capustan. Brood agrees and says that on the surface, the majority of their forces must be seen marching overland at a pace as a feint to throw off the Seer’s plans. The two groups agree that beyond Capustan, they must strike at the heart of the Domin—Coral. Brood says yes—they’ll liberate the cities of Setta, Les, and Maurik then attack Coral. Whiskeyjack says the armies will march overland—no boats—so as not to make the Pannion commander, Kulpath, hurry his forces. He then asks about Rake and Brood says Moon’s Spawn is moving toward the Domin and will “disappear” so as to be an unpredictable asset. When he says the Andii have “formidable sorceries” Silverfox says it won’t be enough. Kallor interrupts to say Silverfox shouldn’t be trusted, that “betrayal is her oldest friend.” He points out she is killing the Mhybe and should be killed herself. Silverfox is horrified by the revelation. The Mhybe says it is what it is, and that there is an “urgency” inside Silverfox, a “force ancient and undeniable.” At which point Kallor interrupts again and says “you don’t know the half of it,” then grabs Silverfox and yells “you’re in there, aren’t you? . . . Come out, bitch.” Brood orders Kallor to let her go and says if he touches her again he will beat her. Whiskeyjack says if Kallor does it he will “rip your heart out.” When Kallor answers “I shake with fear,” Whiskeyjack backhands him. Kallor starts to draw his sword but Brood grabs him and says he “earned” it and if Brood needs to he’ll use his hammer (Burn’s hammer) on Kallor. Kallor agrees and Brood lets him go. Whiskeyjack asks who Silverfox is. She answers that she is Tattersail and Nightchill and that Tattersail’s death happened inside a Tellann warren (at which point Artanthos flinches) and that a Bonecaster from the distant past and an Elder God and a mortal helped her be born in the Tellann warren and in the Rhivi plain and she “belongs to the T’lan Imass.” Kallor snorts at the the name Nightchill as a “lack of imagination” and wonders if K’rul even knew. Silverfox goes on to say the T’lan Imass are gathering and will be needed against the Pannion Seer. They are gathering due to her birth—a summoning every T’lan Imass on the world has heard and will try to answer.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Whiskeyjack recalls Pale, “a plague of suspicions, a maelstrom of desperate schemes. A’Karonys. Bellurdan. Nightchill. Tattersail. The list of mages whose deaths could be laid at High Mage Tayschrenn’s sandaled feet was written in the blood of senseless paranoia.” He’s glad Tayschrenn left them but suspects he didn’t go far. Whiskeyjack understands that Silverfox knows the outlawing of the Malazans is a sham. Looking at her, he sees Tattersail. He recalls what he had heard of Nightchill: a wielder of High Rashan, one of the Emperor’s chosen, mate to Bellurdan, hard-edged—and he worries about Nightchill’s influence within Silverfox. He then remembers that Paran was Tattersail’s love and wonders what this will mean and do to Paran. He grieves for the Mhybe and thinks despite Kallor’s advice he will not stand for a child being harmed, though he wonders if she is really a “child.” He makes eye contact with Korlat and after noting her beauty realizes she’s trying to tell him that Silverfox is indeed a child, a blank slate, one that might be influenced by those close to her.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Crone is terrified by what has been revealed: that Silverfox controls the T’lan Imass, that K’rul—who knows the Raven’s secret—is involved, at Silverfox’s carelessness in all she reveals. Crone worries Rake might learn that the Ravens were born as maggots from the Crippled God’s flesh at his Fall. She notes they were also at the chaining and have been “honorable guardians of the Crippled God’s magic,” magic they can unleash as well. Crone thinks it was lucky for Brood that the T’lan Imass alliance with the Malazan Empire ended with the death of the Emperor, but then thinks that Brood also never “truly unleashed the Andii . . . let loose Anomander Rake . . has ever shown his own true power . . . Tennes—the power of the land itself . . . the power to shatter mountains.” Crone thinks too that what lies at the heart of the Pannion Domin is a mystery but Silverfox knows, and knows the T’lan Imass will be needed. She wonders both what that secret is as well as what it is that Kallor knows about Silverfox.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>The Myhbe recognizes that Silverfox is seeking allies, that Tattersail/Nightchill are reaching out to the Malazans. She sees the alliance is fragile and wonders what Dujek will do. Dujek asks why the Malazan Empire knew nothing of other T’lan Imass beyond the armies of Logros. Silverfox says the First Gathering bound the Imass to each and every one, making them immortal in the cause of war. Kallor interrupts to say that the Jaghut were pacifists save a few Tyrants. Silverfox counters Kallor is hardly the one to talk about injustice and says the Nightchill part of her knows what Kallor did—that he “laid waste an entire realm . . . left nothing but ash and charred bones” and identifies it as the Imperial Warren. Silverfox continues to instruct Dujek by saying Logros and the clans under him were tasked with defending the First Throne while the rest went to fight Jaghut, which proved “costly” and many armies were decimated. Others, she says, may still be fighting. Dujek says when the Logros left, they went into the Jhag Odhan and came back “much diminished.” Silverfox says she is unsure if the Logros have answered her call, though she says she senses one army nearby. The Mhybe sees Silverfox is not telling all. Dujek asks Brood if they should continue discussing strategy. As they do so, the Mhybe, Silverfox, Korlat, and Whiskeyjack exit. Whiskeyjack tells Silverfox he sees much of Tattersail in her and she says she recalls faces and feelings. She names some and says her thoughts of Tayschrenn confuse her, no “sense of loyalty, no sense of trust.” She says she does recall Paran and has in fact met him already, when he had Oponn’s sword and caught all the lances on it. She tells WJ he knows she’s alive and he can send word to Paran. He says they’re all coming anyway. Silverfox knows he wants to have Quick Ben and Mallet examine her and says she’s curious herself what they will discover. Korlat and Whiskeyjack leave together.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Whiskeyjack says Silverfox revealed too much. Korlat agrees and muses on all the T’lan Imass have “witnessed” and remember: the Fall, the arrival of the Tiste Andii, the “last flight of the Dragons into Starvald Demelain.” When WJ mentions how flustered Crone got, Korlat reveals the great “secret” and says the Andii all know. In fact, Rake finds the power in Crone (the First Born) “appalling” and so keeps her and her kin close. Korlat says she’s looking forward to meeting Quick Ben, whom she recalls from their clash in Darujhistan. She tells him Silverfox trusts him and she does as well. When he recounts for her what he knows of the events of Tattersail’s death, Korlat wonders: they know she has Nightchill and Tattersail in her, but where is Bellurdan? Whiskeyjack thinks he has no idea.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Four</strong></p><p>SCENE ONE</p><p>Gruntle watches a fellow caravan guard, Buke, approach Bauchelain’s carriage, seemingly in search of a job. Buke’s wife, mother, and four children had died in a fire while Buke was lying drunk in an alley just around the corner and Gruntle thinks he’s had a death wish ever since. When Gruntle and Buke speak, Buke tells him he believes Korbal Broach is the killer responsible for two weeks of murders in Darujhistan and Gruntle realizes Buke plans on trying to stop/kill Broach or die trying. Stonny arrives and though she doesn’t know the full story, asks Buke when he’s going to start living again.</p><p>SCENE TWO</p><p>Quick Ben meets an old woman in Pale, who refers to Quick Ben as a “snake of the desert,” “many-headed snake,” and “twelve-souls.” Quick asks her why Burn sleeps and about the idea that there are earthquakes and eruptions when Burn “stirs towards wakefulness.” The witch tells him these are “natural things . . . bound to their own laws of cause and effect.” She compares the world to a “beetle’s ball of dung [traveling] through a chilling void around the sun” and says Burn is the “egg within the dung,” the “pain of existence. The queen of the hive and we her workers and soldiers. And every now and then we swarm.” Quick tells her Burn is sick and she agrees. Quick then objects to the image of humanity (and others) as workers, saying it sounds like they’re “slaves.” The witch replies that Burn “demands nothing . . . Yet all that you do serves her no matter what you do. Not simply benign . . . but amoral. We can thrive or we can destroy ourselves, it matters not to her.” Quick asks again why the goddess sleeps and the witch says, “to dream.” She continues by saying she is “fevered” now (her sickness) and thus her “dreams become nightmares.” Quick Ben says he needs to figure out a way to stop the infection, and that he’ll need help. The witch says he may call on her and asks him to make sure he shuts the door on the way out, as “I prefer the cold.”</p><p>SCENE THREE</p><p>Paran, Quick Ben, Mallet, and Spindle are to join the parley at Brood’s camp. Mallet tells Paran he can sense a “new power” from Brood’s camp, something with “hints of T’lan Imass” that is “overpowering everyone else.” As they ride, Spindle’s warren is causing all sorts of chaos around them with animals. Paran’s mind wanders as they ride: he recalls Itko Kan; wonders about the rumors of pending rebellion in Seven Cities, and thinks of how his sister Tavore—”cold and canny” and “not the type to accept defeat”—will protect their House and especially Felisin from Laseen’s current purge, though he’d probably “recoil from using whatever methods she’s chosen.” They’re met by Whiskeyjack and Dujek and the others ride off, leaving Dujek to speak with Paran. Dujek tells him his father died and his mother “elected to join him,” that Tavore salvaged what she could of their holdings, became Adjunct, and sent Felisin to the Otataral Mines, where Dujek says she’ll probably be “quietly retrieved.” Paran blames himself for all of it, but tells Dujek “it is all right . . . the children of my parents are . . . capable of virtually anything.”</p><p>SCENE FOUR</p><p>Later, Paran sorrows over it all alone. Whiskeyjack joins him and tells him Silverfox is Tattersail reborn, and is also Nightchill. Paran looks at Silverfox where she and others wait at the foot of the barrow he and Whiskeyjack stand atop and says she’s more than just Nightchill and Tattersail; she’s a Soletaken. Whiskeyjack tells Paran that Silverfox has named him “Jen’isand Rul” which means “the Wanderer within the Sword” and that Silverfox says Paran is set apart from mortals or ascendants; he’s been “marked” (something Quick Ben senses as well). Paran tells him of seeing Rake kill two Hounds of Shadow, getting their blood on/in him, of entering Dragnipur and freeing the Hounds trapped inside. Whiskyjack says not to tell the Tiste Andii about it. When Paran says he doesn’t want to meet Silverfox, Whiskeyjack says it’s beyond just Paran (and his relationship with Tattersail), that Silverfox has lots of power and Kallor wants to kill her, though right now the Malazans, Brood, and Korlat are against it. Whiskeyjack wants Paran to help draw Tattersail forth to be the dominating soul inside Silverfox.</p><p>SCENE FIVE</p><p>Picker, Trotts, Detoran, Spindle, Hedge, and Blend steal the map table from Brood’s tent and bring it to an empty tent. Hedge lets them know how he and Fiddler rigged the earlier games and they’re going to pull it again with Spindle taking Fiddler’s place so they can take money from the other squads.</p><p>SCENE SIX</p><p>The rigging no longer seems to work and the Seventh Squad lost lots of money. Spindle crawls under the table and says there’s an image painted underneath like a big card. Hedge says he and Fiddler didn’t put it there. Spindle says it’s a “new card. Unaligned, without an aspect.” It has a figure in the middle with a dog-head on its chest. Spindle thinks he can make a copy and do a reading, figure out the card so they can re-rig the table.</p><p>SCENE SEVEN</p><p>Paran and Silverfox are together. Paran feels Nightchill’s presence “entwined like wires of black iron through all that was Tattersail . . . a bitter, demanding presence . . . She knows she was betrayed at the Enfilade at Pale. Both her and . . . Bellurdan.” Paran asks why the Gathering and Silverfox says the T’lan Imass are gathering for her “benediction,” but the alliance will need the T’lan Imass’ “full strength” for the upcoming war with the Pannion. She tells Paran that Tattersail believes the Deck of Dragons is “a kind of structure imposed on power itself. each card is a gate into a warren and there were once many more cards . . . may have been other Decks.” She continues by saying “there is also a kind of structure focused upon power itself . . . Houses . . . Holds.” She believes the Houses of the Azath and Houses of the Deck are the same or linked. When he recalls rumors that Kellanved and Dancer found a way into the Deadhouse in Malaz City, she tells him they have ascended and are now Shadowthrone and Cotillion/Rope. He asks why, since they went into the Deadhouse, they didn’t take the aspect of the House of Death and Silverfox theorizes it’s because that House is already occupied by Hood, King of High House Death. If, however, each Azath is linked to all others, gaining entrance to one as ST and Cotillion did allows one to choose, so they picked an empty House/throne and so the House of Shadow appeared. She adds it was once a Hold, “bestial, a wilder place, and apart from the Hounds it knew no ruler for a long, long time.”</p><p>Paran asks about the Unaligned and she makes a few guesses: “Failed aspects? The imposition of chance, of random forces? The Azath and the Deck are both impositions of order but even order needs freedom.” He asks what it all has to do with him and she begins with Rake: “Rake is Knight of the House of Dark, yet where is the House itself? Before all else there was Dark . . . so it must be an ancient place, or Hold, or something that came before Holds themselves. A focus for the gate into Kurald Galain . . . the First Wound, with a soul trapped in its maw, thus sealing it.” Paran then picks up the train of thought: “Or a legion of souls . . .Before Houses there were Holds . . . both stationary. Settled. Before settlement there was wandering. House from Hold. Hold from a gate in motion . . . a wagon, burdened beneath the countless souls sealing the gate into Dark.” Silverfox interrupts to say she thinks Paran is now the Master of the Deck, “birthed by accident or by some purpose the need of which only the Azath know.” When he scoffs, she tells him “An unseen war has begun, Paran. The warrens themselves are under assault . . . An army is being assembled perhaps, and you—a soldier—are part of that army.” He tells her about his dreams of a child screaming inside a wound. She tells him to run toward the child, not away. He says he is always “the wrong choice.” He thinks Whiskeyjack and the other Malazans also put their faith in him mistakenly. As he looks at them he thinks at least he can tell WJ that Tattersail appears to be at the forefront, though he closes with the idea: “I will fail you all.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Five</strong></p><p>SCENE ONE</p><p>Toc has been traveling for two days with Lady Envy, Tool, the Seguleh, and the two “dogs”—Garath and Baaljagg. Toc tells Envy her flirtations make him nervous. Tool teaches Toc the making of arrows. As they watch Tool flake obsidian Toc, in answer to Envy’s question, says iron was discovered half a thousand years ago and before that people used bronze, before that copper and tin, and before that probably stone. Envy says humans as usual focus only on humans, and that the Elder Races knew quite sophisticated forging methods, and mentions Dragnipur. Toc says sorcery replaces “technological advancement . . . supplanting the progress of mundane knowledge.” Tool gives Toc some info on Lady Envy. Rake, Brood, and a sorceress who later ascended to become Queen of Dreams used to wander together. Rake was joined by Envy and Osric while Brood went off on his own. Brood was gone for score centuries and reappeared a thousand years ago or so carrying Burn’s Hammer. Meanwhile there was a falling out among the trio: Osric left and Rake and Envy eventually parted “argumentatively” before the chaining of the Crippled God, which Rake attended and Envy did not. The two discuss the Seguleh and Toc says he thinks Mok’s twin stripes means he is the Third highest Seguleh and says there is a legendary Seguleh with an unmarked white porcelain mask that only the Seguleh have seen. Tool asks Senu why the Seguleh came here and he answers they are the “punitive army of the Seguleh.” Usually their Blackmasks (First Level Initiates) kill everyone who comes to the island but as the unarmed invaders—priests of the Pannion—kept coming, and then threatened an army, the Seguleh decided to deal with the source. Tool asks how old Senu is and he says fourteen (Tool had been greatly impressed by Senu’s swordsmanship).</p><p>SCENE TWO</p><p>Thurule attacks Tool. As they fight, Envy tells Toc how Rake once visited the Seguleh island (not knowing anything about them) and because he deferred to none, ended up fighting Seguleh for two bells and eventually had to step into his warren to slow his heart rate. Mok says the Seguleh call him Blacksword and that his people still hold the Seventh Mask for Rake to claim. Tool wins the fight. When he tells Toc he used only the flat of his blade Mok is taken aback. Envy, over Mok’s objection, heals Thurule then forbids any more fighting.</p><p>SCENE THREE</p><p>Whiskey, Quick Ben, and Mallet are together on the same hill where they found Tattersail and Hairlock in GoTM. WJ asks for a report. Mallet says Paran’s blood has the “taint of ascendant blood and ascendant places . . . like shoves down a corridor” and the more he refuses to go the sicker he gets. Quick Ben says Paran is pretty much an ascendant himself. Quick Ben wonders where the Hounds went that Paran freed and says his link to one of them makes Paran unpredictable. He suggests they shove Paran down that corridor themselves, even if they don’t know what’s at the end of it. They worry about Nightchill taking the dominant role in Silverfox. Quick says her warren was Rashan, Darkness and Whiskeyjack recalls her as “remote, cold.” Quick Ben thinks to himself how there have been “other Nightchills long before the Malazan Empire . . . two thousand years ago . . . if she’s the same one.” Whiskeyjack tells them to keep pushing Paran and find out everything they can about Nightchill.</p><p>SCENE FOUR</p><p>Whiskeyjack and Dujek meet. They say there is a lot of power marshaled against the Pannion and wonder what that implies. WJ reports Twist has said “his flights should remain unseen . . . he has scouts seeking a strategic place to hold up close to the Pannion Border.” The two discuss Quick Ben initiating contact with the Grey Swords in Capustan. Whiskeyjack says the Second Gathering is causing some consternation, as is the idea that the T’lan will be needed in the war. Dujek and Whiskeyjack discuss Kellanved’s surprising “restraint” in his use of the Imass and worry about them being led by a child. Dujek says they need to make sure Tattersail takes the reins. Whiskeyjack says Kallor will try to kill Silverfox but Dujek disagrees, saying Kallor worries about Brood. He says friend or foe, you don’t want to mess with Brood, and rumor is the hammer is the only thing that can wake up Burn. Dujek, though, worries that Kallor will try to persuade Brood, and later Rake, to his view re Silverfox. Whiskeyjack says he will not stand the killing of a child, even if Dujek commands him to. They get themselves another drink.</p><p>SCENE FIVE</p><p>Brood wonders aloud to the Mhybe if maybe Kallor might be right and the Mhybe says they’ll kill Silverfox over her dead body. Brood says it pains him to see what Silverfox is doing to the Mhybe. The Mhybe explains that “blood-bound lives are the web that carries each of us, they make up that which a life climbs from newborn . . . to adulthood. Without such life-forces, one withers and dies. To be alone is to be ill.” She says for Silverfox, the Mhybe is the only one as the Imass have no life-force to give and Tattersail and Nightchill were both dead. When Brood asks why its accelerated, why Silverfox is so “impatient,” Korlat asks if he thinks she’s doing so in order to have more authority (since she’ll no longer be a child) when the Second Gathering occurs. The Mhybe says whereas the Andii or Brood have the centuries “of living necessary to contain what you command, Silverfox does not . . .to fully command [great power] she must be a grown woman.” The three agree that a concern is that even then, she will be “untempered,” lacking experience. Korlat speculates Silverfox may also be hurrying her growth to be able to defend herself against Kallor and they wonder what is the secret between the two of them. Brood asks if she does not have “experience” via the other souls in her. The Mhybe says she is still learning of the others and is comforted by what she sees of Tattersail, less so by Nightchill, of whom she senses “a seething anger, a hunger for vengeance, possibly against Tayschrenn (of Bellurdan she says he is only a memory of Nightchill). When Brood says wasn’t it Rake who killed Nightchill, Korlat says not, she was betrayed by Tayschrenn. Brood suggests they try to ensure Tattersail is dominant and when Korlat says trust Whiskeyjack to do just that, Brood says he hears “her heart in [her] words.” Brood tells the Mhybe to keep an eye on Silverfox.</p><p>SCENE SIX</p><p>The Darujhistan contingent arrives to meet with the above group, as well as Dujek, Whiskeyjack, Twist, Paran, Kallor, and Silverfox. The Mhybe thinks she’s ready to die now that Silverfox has gotten allies. Kruppe is first to arrive and the Mhybe says they’ve met before, at Silverfox’s birth. Kruppe sees what Silverfox has done to the Mhybe and is struck silent in sorrow. Murillio and Coll, along with Estraysian D’arle, (the “official” Darujhistan delegation) arrive. Kruppe suggests using the Trygalle Trade Guild to supply the army and all agree.</p><p>SCENE SEVEN</p><p>Crone senses magic from within the camp and seeking it out, finds Brood’s table. She listens in to a group of Bridgeburners. Spindle had done several Deck readings and each time “Obelisk dominates—the dolmen of time is the core. It’s active . . . first time in decades.” Spindle also says the new card (the one under the table) holds everything together but it feels like it hasn’t “woken up yet.” He continues with his reading: “Soldier of High House Death’s right-hand to Obelisk. Magi of Shadow’s here—first time for that one too—a grand deception’s at work . . . The Captain of High House Light holds out some hope, but it’s shaded by Hood’s Herald—though not directly . . . Assassin of High House Shadow seems to have acquired a new face . . . it’s Kalam!” Based on the reading they guess the Whirlwind is rising and Seven Cities is ready to rebel. Crone checks out the card under the table.</p><p>SCENE EIGHT</p><p>The Mhybe leaves the command tent and is followed by Paran, who asks about possible hiding places for a table. She leads him to the tent. On the way they discuss the Malazan invasion. Paran tells her Dujek’s army was being “chewed to bits” and the arrival of Brood, Rake, and the Crimson Guard stopped the Malazans cold. It was only the mages and the Moranth munitions keeping the Malazans going, but the Moranth are in a schism, with the Blue and Gold still working with the Malazans. Near the table’s tent, they come across Crone, who flees Paran for some reason. Paran orders Hedge, Spindle, Blend and Picker to return the table. Spindle says “it’s him” (meaning the picture under the table is Paran). As Paran and the Mhybe leave, he tells her he has no idea what Spindle was talking about.</p><p>SCENE NINE</p><p>Paran meets Whiskeyjack, who tells him Kruppe, Coll, and Murillo will be joining the march and that the Black Moranth will take Paran and the Bridgeburners to the Barghast Mountains in hopes that Trotts will get the White Face Barghast as allies, then they are to continue on to Capustan. Rake appears in dragon form in the Andii part of the camp.</p><p>SCENE TEN</p><p>Kallor tells Rake he seeks his justice with regard to Silverfox and not to let “sentiment” guide him. Korlat and the Mhybe also try to speak to him. When Rake says it appears his judgment has been anticipated, Brood says he will not allow Dragnipur’s unsheathing in his camp. The Mhybe worries things are on the edge of collapse and then thinks she senses power from Artanthos, but then dismisses the possibility. Korlat says she sides with Brood and when Rake tells Kallor he stands alone, Kallor says “it was ever thus,” a response with which Rake can empathize. Whiskeyjack arrives and stands before Silverfox then unsheathes his sword to face Rake and Kallor and the rest. Rake sends out a sorcerous feeler toward Silverfox and it is quickly shattered by her, as the Mhybe senses rage from both Nightchill and Tattersail and “another. A stolid will, a sentience slow to anger, so much like Brood.” Rake wonders what is being hidden from him and as he reaches for his sword, Brood reaches for his hammer and Whiskeyjack raises his own sword. Just then, Brood’s table appears flying overhead with Kruppe hanging from it.</p><p>SCENE ELEVEN</p><p>Back with Picker’s group, she sees Paran disappear. She calls for someone to find Quick Ben.</p><p>SCENE TWELVE</p><p>Paran appears facing Rake and Kallor. At Kruppe’s cry he looks up to see the table floating above, his face painted on the bottom. Sudden pain overcomes him.</p><p>SCENE THIRTEEN</p><p>The Mhybe sees tendrils of power reach from Silverfox to the table. The legs snap off and Kruppe falls. The underside of the table faces Rake and Kallor, with waves of sorcery coming off the image of Paran then touching Paran in “silver chains.” Quick Ben arrives and says “that’s the largest card of the Deck I’ve ever seen.” He steps between the two groups and says a confrontation perhaps isn’t the smartest idea. Rake sheathes Dragnipur and asks who Quick Ben is. Quick says “just a soldier.” Kruppe arrives and stands between Paran and Rake and asks if the meeting has adjourned.</p><p>SCENE FOURTEEN</p><p>Paran finds himself in a hallway. Two bodies lie there—Rallick Nom and Vorcan—which places him in the Finnest House in Darujhistan. A Jaghut enters and introduces himself as Raest, “Guardian, prisoner, damned,” then notes Paran is here only in spirit. When Paran asks why he [Paran] is here, Raest leads him down some steps. Paran asks how long Nom and Vorcan have been there and Raest says he doesn’t measure time inside the House; they were there when he arrived. Paran asks if they are Guardians as well and Raest says no. Raest names him Master of the Deck. They reach a landing where the ground is a bunch of roots and Raest says Paran has to go on by himself. Paran asks why the Azath has suddenly found the need for a Master of the Deck and Raest answers because a war has begun that will affect all entities: mortals, Houses, gods, etc. Paran moves forward and finds himself on a flagstoned floor where each stone has a card carved on it. He bends to study one and finds himself before a hut made of bones and tusks (the image on the stone) and realizes he can travel at will from there. He enters the hut and finds twin thrones of bone on a dais of what appear to be T’lan Imass skulls—The Hold of the Beasts, “the heart of the T’lan Imass’ power—their spirit world when they were still flesh and blood, when they still possessed spirits to be worshipped . . . long before they initiated the Ritual of Tellann.” He realizes the Tellann warren must have been born from the Ritual, “aspected of dust.” He grieves for the Imass, having outlived their own gods, existing “in a world of dust . . . memories untethered, an eternal existence, no end in sight . . . so alone for so long.”</p><p>SCENE FIFTEEN</p><p>He returns to the flagstone area and looks at a stone etched with the image of a sleeping woman. He sees it is Burn and that her skin is forest and bedrock, and so on, and also that she is “marred.” Looking closer, he sees “at the wound’s heart, a humped, kneeling, broken figure. Chained. Chained to Burn’s own flesh. From the figure, down the length of the chains, poison flowed into the Sleeping Goddess.” Continuing to study it, he realizes “she sensed the sickness coming . . . chose to sleep . . . to escape the prison of her own flesh in order to do battle . . . She made of herself a weapon. Her entire spirit, all its power, into a single forging . . . a hammer . . . capable of breaking anything . . . then found a man to wield it . . .but breaking the chains meant freeing the Crippled God. And an unchained Crippled God meant an unleashing of vengeance—enough to sweep all life from the surface of the world. And yet Burn . . . was indifferent to that. She would simply begin again.” Of Brood, Paran understands “he refuses . . . to defy the Crippled God’s unleashing . . . Brood refuses her.” Paran pulls back, weeping, and finds himself back with Raest, who asks if he’s found knowledge a gift or curse and Paran answers both.</p><p>SCENE SIXTEEN</p><p>Paran returns to in front of Rake. Silverfox puts a hand on his shoulder. Quick Ben, eying Rake, steps closer to Paran. Rake says Quick Ben’s advice seems wise. Kallor says now is the time to kill Silverfox before she gets even more powerful. Rake says what if they fail, not to mention she has only acted in self-defense. Brood sheathes his hammer and says it’s about time wisdom prevailed. He asks Paran if he can do something about the floating table. Quick Ben says he might be able to, which causes Rake to note he’s not simply a soldier as he had said. Quick downplays his ability then tells Rake not to quest toward him. Rake turns away.</p><p>SCENE SEVENTEEN</p><p>The Mhybe hobbles off, in great pain, the tribal wards against pain—copper on wrists and ankles—seemingly not doing anything. She falls to her knees and Crone speaks to her, grieving for her and asking how she can help. The Mhybe says Crone cannot, and tells her she is nearing hatred for Silverfox at what is happening to herself. Crone says she will find a way to help and the Mhybe says it is impossible. Korlat arrives and raises the Mhybe up and tells her she will also try to help, will remain at the Mhybe’s side and will not let her give in to despair and kill herself.</p><p>SCENE EIGHTEEN</p><p>Brood tells Rake Burn is dying. Rake asks if there is anything Brood can do and Brood says only the same old choice. Rake says he, Hood, Brood and the Queen of Dreams all agreed about the Crippled God. Rake asks what happens if Burn dies and Brood says he does not know all, but that her warren will die, will become the Crippled God’s way into all the other warrens, which will then all die, and all sorcery as well, which Brood says may not be so bad. But Rake says the destruction will not end there, and it appears no matter which of the two choices Brood makes, the CG wins, though at least Brood is giving the living extra time. To which Brood answers, time spent warring and killing one another. Rake changes the subject and asks if given Burn’s illness if Brood had been bluffing earlier. Brood says he can still raise power but it is filled with chaos and unpredictable. They turn to the Pannion Domin and Rake says chaos is at its core. Brood says it can’t be a coincidence, since chaos is the Chained One’s power. When Rake says that adds a complication Brood says Silverfox has said they’ll need more and has summoned the T’lan Imass, which doesn’t particularly please Rake.</p><p>SCENE NINETEEN</p><p>Kallor tells Whiskeyjack he is a fool and will regret protecting Silverfox. Whiskeyjack walks away and Kallor tells him he isn’t done with Whiskeyjack. Whiskeyjack asks Quick Ben about the table-card of Paran and Quick identifies Paran as the Master of the Deck and says he’ll have to think about how that is linked to him also being the Wanderer in the Sword. He suggests they have the Trygalle Guild take the card to Baruk. Silverfox says that’s a bad idea, as Paran will be needing it because “we struggle against more than one enemy.” Kallor steps in and Quick Ben says he’s not part of the conversation. Kallor threatens Quick, who makes a hole under Kallor’s feet, then leaves. As do the others.</p><p>SCENE TWENTY</p><p>Whiskeyjack watches the march start. Twist has already taken Paran and the Bridgeburners several days earlier. He and Quick Ben discuss how Silverfox has grown five years since the parley and the Mhybe is on the edge of death. He’s also worried about Rake’s probing. Whiskeyjack says he needs Quick for a little while more then asks what else Quick is up to that has him visiting every temple and seer and Deck reader, not to mention sacrificing a goat. Quick Ben tries to change the subject by noting that the Rhivi spirits are all gone, recently “cleaned out,” but then tells Whiskeyjack he’s doing some investigating and it won’t interfere. Whiskeyjack can tell Quick is worried about something big.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Six</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Gruntle, Stonny, and Harllo escort Keruli’s carriage into Saltoan. There they meet some thugs who are to escort Keruli to a meeting of the underworld.</p><p>SCENE 2/3</p><p>Keruli address the underworld gathering about the priests of the Pannion Domin entering into Saltoan “sowing discord.” He talks as well of the Children of the Dead Seed, birthed when their mothers had sex with “corpses not yet cold,” and of the savagery of the Tenescowri. When someone suggests simply killing the priests, Keruli says they must fight back with words—”crafted rumours and counter-intelligence.” Gruntle overhears Harllo talking about how Saltoan has seen unexplained murders for several nights now and Gruntle thinks to himself Buke has found proof of his suspicions regarding Korbald and Bauchelain. Keruli tells Gruntle the stop in Saltoan was a detour and they’ll continue on to Capustan.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Gruntle exits the city after Keruli’s carriage has already left with Stonny and Harllo. He comes across what looks like a failed bandit attack on Korbald and Bauchelain’s carriage. He catches up to the group and at Keruli’s insistence they join with three White Face Barghast siblings that are also traveling to Capustan: Hetan and her two brothers Cafal and Netok. They have been sent by their tribe to look into the presence of demons on the wildlands.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>The Barghast say the demons have been described as “fast on two legs. Talons like an eagle’s, only much larger, at the ends of those legs. Their arms are blades,” as seen in the Barghast’s shouldermen’s dream-visions. Hetan tells them her father (the warchief) will not lead the clans south to Capustan, but that the shouldermen have seen that the Pannion War will come to them.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>As they continue, Hetan explains the Barghast bury trees upside down to hold souls from wandering and that traps are also placed around the souls, though some still escape. Those who return to the clans are destroyed, others (called sticksnares) send dreams to the shouldermen. The group comes across Bauchelain’s carriage, wrecked after a fight. Behind it an upside-down tree/burial mound opens up. Inside the carriage they discover a mass of organs formed together in a human-shape (though only knee-high) and Gruntle realizes that’s why Korbal had been killing people. Korbal, Bauchelain, Buke, and Emancipor show up. Bauchelain said they freed the spirit to learn of the Barghast and only learned the Barghast were one “far more numerous [and] accomplished seafarers.” When asked what they did with the spirit, he says nothing (though they control it) it had already “fallen prey” to one of the traps—a bundle of sticks. They were then attacked and he admits they barely held off the three “demons”. When Gruntle reports to Keruli, Keruli tells him there are lots more of these demons and are in fact behind them as well as in front of them and so he thinks they need to ally with the necromancers until Capustan. Gruntle advises Buke to take the money and run when they get to Capustan. Buke says they’ll never make it; the necromancers threw everything they had at the demons and barely made it.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>The next day, Gruntle continues to advise Buke to let Korbal go, and tries to guilt him into it with the fact that Stonny cares for him, but Buke doesn’t care. They argue then move on. Buke again says they won’t live through the night. They prepare for attack at night and Gruntle asks Keruli what they can expect from his god and Keruli says he doesn’t know; it’s a newly awakened Elder god. Keruli then cuts his palm for blood. Six demons attack: reptiles about twice the height of a man with swords fused to their wrists. Keruli identifies them as K’Chain Che’Malle Hunters (undead). After some fighting on everyone’s part, a badly wounded Gruntle blacks out.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Seven</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>The setting is inside Capustan. Karanadas (Destriant of the Grey Swords) looks out at the palace of Prince Jelarkan, where Brukhalian (the Mortal Sword) was meeting with the prince and members of the Mask Council, negotiations which have been going on (ineffectively) for weeks. He is angry at/disgusted with Fener’s priest on the Mask Council who seems more concerned with his own political power and desire to be Destriant (Rath’Fener doesn’t know Karnadas already is and Brukhalian has forbidden Karnadas from revealing it). Itkovian (Shield Anvil) enters to tell him Brukhalian has returned. Brukhalian says Rath’Trake senses demons on the plains. Karnadas is upset that Trake is rising (another God of War). They discuss the anonymous “invitation” they’ve received and decide to reply. Quick Ben appears and at first dismisses the Grey Swords as “mere” mercenaries but he likes much of what he hears. Brukhalian tells Quick the city doesn’t believe in women warriors and so the Grey Swords are recruiting among the female population in Capustan. When Quick says he wants to contact the “leaders,” Brukhalian describes how the city is split into factions: the Mask Council (itself split) and Prince Jelarkan, whom the Grew Swords serve. Quick stuns them with his knowledge that Karnadas, as Destriant, outranks Rath’Fener. Quick tells them Brood is leading an army to Capustan and they set up another time to meet before Quick exits. Both Karnadas and Burkhalian recognize they will lose the war. Karnadas says his earlier sensation that Quick Ben had multiple souls must have been wrong.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Back with Quick Ben, Whiskeyjack says he thinks Brukhalian looked tough. Quick says he thinks the titles (Mortal Sword, Destriant) are for show, as they are so ancient and have been vacant for so long. He says that before the Deck of Dragon’s recognized Knights of Houses, Fener’s cult had its own. Whiskeyjack isn’t so sure the titles are for show. Quick doesn’t think much of the Grey Swords; WJ is not so sure of that as well.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Riding through the Capustan streets, Itkovian muses on the past history of its residents, once nomadic, and how the city is still set up in “Camps” (districts). The old keep (where the Grey Swords are) is older and the Prince’s palace older still, with unknown architecture. He takes out a company, including a new female recruit. They find the trail of some K’Chain (they don’t know what they are) and fight one, killing it but at great cost. Four more appear, but before the Grey Swords can do anything, a T’lan Imass appears and tells them they are “relieved,” and Itkovian watches as an army of T’lan destroy the undead K’Chain, at the cost of roughly 60 T’lan Imass. The first T’lan introduces hiimself as Pran Chole of the Kron and says they had come for the Gathering but seem to have found a war.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Itkovian will ride as bait on the plains while the Imass trail them to try and kill more K’Chain. He wants to send the recruit back to make report, thinking she’s probably broken, but she doesn’t want to go and he agrees. He tells her seeing the K’Chain get destroyed won’t make her feel better and she seems to recognize that. Pran tells them about the K’Chain Hunters, that whatever is controlling them is somewhere to the south, that they were released from a barrow at Morn, possibly by the Matron who appears to have escaped her own prison barrow. When Itkovian says they are in a war with the Pannion Seer, the entire T’lan army reacts and Pran says Pannion is a Jaghut name.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Toc thinks on all the “coincidences” that have put him on the path he’s on. He jokingly asks Baaljagg (the Ay) where its family is and he gets a vision in his lost eye of Ay and oxen trapped in mud (this is the scene from the prologue) and Baaljagg running away. Then a vision of an Elder god telling Baaljagg it is the last Ay and there “will be need for you” and giving a promise to the Ay that the god will bring a “lost spirit . . . suitable.” Baaljagg sleeps in a dreamworld then “the torn soul [was] delivered to her own, where they merged, eventually became one . . . the best now sought something like redress.” Toc realizes it was Tool the Ay waited for. Toc asks Tool what the Ay wants of him and Tool says “an end to her loneliness” but also that he “can do nothing for her.” Tool mentions how “someone has drawn on [his] life-force almost to exhaustion.” He wonders if Toc has bonded souls with the Ay somehow. He asks Toc how he lost his eye and Toc says a falling piece of Moon’s Spawn at the enfilade at Pale. Tool makes a connection to Obelisk (Menhir in the Deck of Holds before the Deck of Dragons) and he gives Toc a new name: Aral Fayle (touched by stone). Toc asks what Tool’s name means and he answers “Onos is “clanless man. T is broken. Ool is veined while lan is flint and in combination T’oolan is flawed flint.” He adds how Logros had been chosen to command the clans native to the First Empire and though Tool’s sister would serve him but instead she defied the ritual and so weakened the Logros T’lan Imass and the First Empire fell. Toll’s brothers went north and never returned. Tool was chosen First Sword but “abandoned” Logros T’lan Imass and now travels alone, “thus committing the greatest crime known among my people.” Toc says but now Tool is returning to his people for the Second Gathering.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Toc suddenly sees through a different beast’s eyes from Baaljag. The creature—which names itself Treach/Trake/Tiger of Summer thinks how it “[found] itself, now at the very end. and memories awakened.” It recalls the madness among the Soletaken, the birthing of the D’ivers, the Empire disintegrating, and how it was one of the few survivors after the T’lan Imass. It remembers tearing “a warren to pieces . . .turned the eastlands into molten stone that cooled and became something that defied sorcery” and how “we fled, a handful . . . Ryllandaras . . . we fell out, clashed, then clashed again on another continent. He had gone teh farthest, found a way to control the gifts—Soletaken and D’iver both. White Jackal . . . And my other companion, Messremb . . . a kind soul . . . Ascending . . . The First Heroes. Dark. Savage.” It remembers losing lost himself in the beast, sending The White Jackal off a ledge, and a memory of a single-eyed wolf and thinks “this vision of the wolf [awakened] all within me.” He was tracking K’Chain and was now dying, left by them. He hears battle and crawls forward. A woman with the fur of a panther meets him and tells him she killed the K’Chain. She says she was around when the Imass dealt with the First Empire, but it was others who repaired the shattered warren. She says the Imass only killed Treach’s kind; it is their “singular skill.” She asks who the other presence in him is that she senses, that has returned Treach to himself and says when he dies he won’t appear at Hood’s gate but “elsewhere.” An Elder God is active again, she adds, perhaps the “most ancient one of all,” and thinks it is answering some grave threat, a new war in which Treach will be needed.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Senu slaps Toc awak. Toc tells Tool he saw Treach die not far north of where they are. A black panther arrives and changes into a flesh and blook Imas—Tool’s sister Kilava. She says she saw Toc looking out through Treach’s eye and asks what the Elder God has planned. Toc says he has no idea. Kilava asks Tool who he is and when Tool says “Aral Fayle” she notes he has given him weapons of stone. Tool says it was unintended but Kilava says they’re all being manipulated. When Tool says he travels to the Second Gathering she says she refuses to and is here for other reason which Toc realizes is “redress.” Then an Elder God’s voice tells him she wants to “right an old wrong, heal an old scar” and that the two of them (Toc and Kilava) will meet again, but the final meeting concerns the god. The god goes on to say the children of the Pannion Seer are suffering and Toc must “release them” and so the god is sending Toc “into the Seer’s embrace,” though he thinks Toc will not forgive him. When Toc asks why the children must be released, the god answers “compassion . . . a man who dreams has shown me this.” Toc speaks the “compassion” out loud and when Tool says his sister knows nothing of it she says all things change. Took and Kilava make some small rapprochement and she says the meeting gives her “hope” before leaving. Toc tells Tools the blood-ties Tool had said were severed between him and Kilava still hold. Tool says he has known only two mortal humans and both “underestimated themselves” and promises to tell Toc (whom he now calls friend) of Adjunct Lorn.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Envy meanwhile had gone to the city of Callows and found it filled with blood and death, maybe 30,000 killed roughly 10 days ago. She senses even Hood is uneasy. She finds an old temple and speaks to K’rul. K’rul tells her Callows death “came from the sea. A warren-twisted fleet. Cold-eyed, unhuman killers. Seeking, ever seeking . . . a worthy challenge.” He also warns the Crippled God is “never so obvious. his game displays a master’s sleight of hand. Ntohing is as he would have us believe and his use of unwitting servants is as brutal as his treatment of enemies. Consider after all the Pannion Seer.” Envy says she doesn’t mourn the passing of the Elder Gods, including her father Draconus. She tells him she’s barely holding onto the Seguleh (if at all) and warns Mok will challenge and defeat Tool. K’rul says he hopes not until they fight their way to the Pannion Seer, though he thinks if they do fight Mok’s restraint might surprise her, though he admits he hadn’t expected such a high-ranking Seguleh to lead the punitive army in his plans to open a second front for the Seer’s armies. He also mentions the Second is missing. He tells Envy she chose to reject helping when they needed her (the Chaining) but now even chained the CG “will not rest. He exists in endless, tormenting pain . . . and has turned that into a fuel for his rage, his hunger for vengeance.” When Envy says those that pulled him down are all dead already and the CG’s “vengeance” is really a cover for lust of power. K’rul isn’t quite sure, but says in any case he won’t allow her indifference yet again. When she bridles, he shows her a vision: “chaos . . . a universe devoide of sense . . .of meaning. Entities flung through the maelstrom. Lost, terrified by the birth of light. A sudden sharpening—pain as of wrist opened, the heat spilling forth—a savage imposition of order, the heart from which blood flowed . . . twin chambers—Kurald Galain, the Warren of Mother Dark—and Starvald Demelain, the Warren of Dragons. And the blood—the power—now seeping in current through veins . . . . the warrens.” K’rul says her power feeds on the blood of his soul and so she will obey and help. She asks who knows the truth and he answers Rake, Draconus, Osric, and a “handful of others.” He confesses he is frightened by the CG and says their “foolishness” has cost them allies, such as Dassem Ultor, who was “broken by Hood’s taking of his daughter at the Time of the Chaining.” She wonders if Hood would have done so had she answered the summons and K’rul says who can say. He continues to say she needed to know the scale of the problem and she agrees to go into the heart of the Domin. K’rul says to take care of Toc, that while K’rul himself will try to keep Toc’s soul from the CG, there is something “wild” in Toc that has yet to awaken. He also warns her his blood is poisoned near the Domin so she won’t be able to access her warren (she could defeat the poison but Toc could not).</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Itkovian’s group comes across Gruntle’s battle scene from the night before. He finds along with the T’lan Imass there hundred of undead Ay (T’lan Ay). Pran grieves for them as they had no choice in the Telann Ritual. Itkovian meets Bauchelain and Korbal. Itkovian’s men will heal the injured but one Barghast is dead and one human.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>Pran Chole tells Itkovian that Korbal is a eunuch, and insane, but Bauchelain is the more dangerous one. Both are necromancers: Korbal “plies the chaos on the edge of Hood’s realm” and Bauchelain is a “summoner of formidable power.” Pran also says the injured mortals (now healed) are all dreaming and being protected. They plan to head back to Capustan, and Itkovian asks that the T’lan Imass and most of the Ay (but not all) remain hidden.</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>The Prince and Brukhalian are upset that the Mask Council will not give up some outlying towers that will certainly be overrun. The Prince leaves and Brukhalian asks Karnadas if Itkovian’s men continue to draw on his healing power. The Destriant says no but he is nearly fully drained. A messenger from Itkovian arrives and tells of the battle with the K’Chaine and the arrival of the T’lan Imass, who rise up beside him. They tell Brukhalian of what is going on with Itkovian’s group. They also say that while they will fight the K’Chain and have suspicions about the Pannion, the Second Gathering will take priority and afterward the T’lan Imass may be “of less value upon completion of hte Gathering.” Karnadas says he’s seen the Pannion and he is only an old human but the Imass ask “who stands in his shadow” and clearly maintain suspicion. The Grey Swords are please to learn of the Ay and Itkovian’s decision to keep some of the visible upon entering the city.</p><p>SCENE 12</p><p>Brukhalian thinks back on the meeting just completed with Quick Ben and Brood and how it was clear there were secrets and that relieving Capustan was not their true or primary goal. Suddenly a warren opens and a Jaghut appears, declaring himself Gethol, Hood’s Herald. He says Hood wants to offer “an invitation” to Fener’s soldiers and when Brukhalian says Gethol should talk to Fener Gethol says he cannot, that Fener has been drawn “to the very edge of his realm [and] is in great peril,” facing the loss of his power. Gethol says Capustan is doomed and Hood can spirit the Grey Swords out, since the Pannion is merely part of a greater war. Brukhalian says Hood is trying to steal Fener’s soldiers and Gethol responds that Fener will be the first “casualty in the war with the Crippled God” and that Brukhalian should be honored by Hood’s offer. Brukhalian strikes Gethol with his sword at the insult and when Gethol appears ready to fight, three T’lan Imass bonecasters appear and he disappears. The bonecasters tell Brukhalian they’ve been hunting that Jaghut for some time and he “talent for escaping” continues.</p><p>SCENE 13</p><p>Gruntle awakens in Capustan. Stonny tells him Harllo is dead and Netok. Gruntle remembers Harllo throwing himself in between Gruntle and the K’Chain.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Eight</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Gethol walks across a landscape of bones, complaining about the unpredictability and insolence of humans. He recognizes that now he is “broken” Hood has discarded him. He opens his Omtose Phellack warren as he tells Hood “I know you now . . . who—what—you are. Delicious irony, the mirror of your face.” Inside the warren, he senses its weakness due to the millennia of T’lan breaches and attacks, and knows Omtose, like the Jaghut, is dying. He comes across a fissure, “sweet with decay and disease”, an “invitation” from the Crippled God. He enters it.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Gethol arrives at the tent of the Crippled God, but demands the God remove the tent as Gethol will not “crawl.” The CG tells Gethol it was Gethol’s desire for vengeance, his “personal desire” that disappointed Hood and in Hood’ s mind threatened Hood’s “meticulous plans.” Gethol recognizes immediately that the CG is poisoning Burn and the CG agrees, saying it will one day kill her and the world will die, telling Gethol “these chains must be broken.” Gethol scoffs at the idea he might help the CG, saying he was there at the Chaining and besides, all worlds die. The CG says Gethol is the weak link, however, having failed Hood now and also when “your brother Gothos called upon you.” The CG then reveals his cards, informing Gethol he plans to “join the game” and offers Gethol the position of Herald, and the possibility of higher, King even. When Gethol warns him the Deck will resist and his House will be “assailed,” the CG says the Deck’s maker “is dust” and thus no one can control it, offering up the resurrected House of Shadows as proof. Gethol agrees.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Murillio, Coll, Kruppe, and Quick Ben are playing a game of bones and Kruppe has won every throw, to Quick’s amazement (not because Kruppe is winning but because he can’t figure out how Kruppe is cheating). Korlat arrives and tells Whiskeyjack Rake would like to see him. Rake tells WJ he is contemplating “the nature of happenstance” and of people who find themselves thrown together for a while and whose lives are therefore changed, no matter how brief the contact. Whiskeyjack tells Rake he doesn’t fear change. Rake continues by saying the tension, the rivalries, etc. among the alliance are clear, but despite that Rake feels a sense of hope. When asked why, Rake brings up Paran, whom he simply “likes.” After some silence, WJ suggests Rake is a bit curious about Quick Ben and goes on to tell the story of how he met him. Quick was a “middling wizard” working for a Seven Cities Protector, one of a 12-mage cadre. The city was taken, Dassem killed the Holy Protector, and the cadre fled into the desert, chased across the entire desert by Whiskeyjack’s thrown together squad of 70 leftovers (including Fiddler, Hedge, Picker—first time under WJ) guided by Kalam, recently recruited into the claw. They come across a corpse at a time as they continue, each one strangely shriveled:</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">Kebharla: “more a scholar than a mage”<br/>Renisha: High Meanas<br/>Keluger: Septime priest of D’riss, the Worm of Autumn<br/>Narkal: warrior mage sworn to Fener<br/>Ullan: Soletaken priestess of Soliel<br/>Set’alahd Crool: Jhag half-blood whose sword was blessed by an unknown ascendant<br/>Etra: mistress of Rashan<br/>Birith’erah: mage of Serc warren of sky<br/>Gellid: witch of Tennes</p><p>As they went on, the squad was tempered, changed by Raraku, “annealed” (a word used to also refer to Stormy et. al “annealed” in the warren of fire aboard Silanda). Finally they come across Quick Ben sitting alone awaiting them. He tells Whiskeyjack he and his men have been changed by the Holy Desert, that Raraku “has burned the bridges of their pasts . . . and they are yours, heart and soul.” Whiskeyjack reveals he’s known for some time that Kalam and Quick had been conspiring, but he was “curious” as to what had been happening with the mages. He asks if their souls “clamor” within Quick Ben and wonders what was the end planned for? Quick Ben says the clamor has “subsided” as being a ghost within is still better than dying. He tells Whiskeyjack the end was only for survival, that they hadn’t thought the squad would make it and now he and Kalam would follow Whiskeyjack if he’ll have them. Whiskeyjack will, but says Surly will take them and Quick says only if she knows. They join the squad and the first engagement was the retaking of G’danisban where the squad of 70 plus Quick and Kalam “crushed” 400 warriors in a night. Even Rake is somewhat stunned at the tale and appreciates that Whiskeyjack told it despite Rake specifically asking for it. Whiskeyjack refers to the same “instinct” Rake had mentioned earlier, implying he “likes” Rake and trusts him. Rake says he was impressed by how WJ defended Silverfox and WJ says he was equally so that Rake stood down. Rake says Kruppe still has him wondering and Whiskeyjack basically says yeah, good luck with that. Rake says he’ll keep his distance from Quick until he leaves so as not to make Quick nervous. He says he enjoyed the evening and maybe he can share some of his own stories sometimes (he has a “few” he says). Before Whiskeyjack leaves he also says Silverfox has nothing to fear from him and he’ll rein in Kallor. Whiskeyjack leaves realizing he’s made a friend this night.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Crone asks Rake if it is wise to make a friend of a “short-lived mortal,” reminding him of his past “tragic” experience with such. Rake’s answer: “one can find precious value in brevity” is vaguely mysterious enough to frustrate Crone and she flies off in a huff once Rake tells her to bring Kallor to him. Rake tells Korlat he is leaving for a while to seek “Silannah’s comfort” and tells her to protect Silverfox and keep a watch on Kallor. He wants to be called if Kallor “errs” but tells Korlat not to hesitate in bringing the “full force” of the Tiste Andii on him if needed. Korlat wonders at that, saying such hasn’t been done for a long time, but Rake says why risk not using enough power. Korlat agrees, but is still troubled at the idea of 1100 Tiste Andii joining warrens when it took only 40 of them at the Chaining to “destroy the Crippled God’s entire realm—granted, a nascent realm . . . Eleven hundred . . . we risk devastating this continent.” Rake says use restraint if it turns out to be needed, but he doubts Kallor will risk anything.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>The Mhybe dreams herself young in the tundra world Silverfox had been born in (Telann), watching large beasts and coming across footprints, a dream she finds torture when she awakes in her broken, old self. She begs the Rhivi spirits to take her life. Kruppe arrives bearing a gift. He tells her that while extending the caverns/tunnels below Darujhistan, rough-hewn chambers were discovered with ancient artwork and rough altars on which were found copper ornaments (anklets, torcs, etc) to ease pain. The Mhybe is touched, but starts to explain while copper heals, it doesn’t work on age, but Kruppe interrupts. He tells her scholars examined the altars, paintings, etc. and says it has been confirmed that these belonged to the original Rhivi spirits—once mortal, perhaps the first band of Rhivi (the same ones the Mhybe just named as she asked them to take her life). The Mhybe wonders in her mind how Kruppe knew she needed such a gift this morning especially. Before leaving, Kruppe tells her not to discount dreams. The Mhybe wonders “whose path did I cross last night.”</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>The scene shifts to Picker and Antsy’s squad getting dropped off by Twist’s Black Moranth at the foot of the Barghast Mountains. Antsy starts to blame Paran and Picker tells him to cool that kind of talk. Paran tells them Quick Ben has been delayed and that Antsy’s squad is to remain to escort him to catch up to the rest of them who are leaving with Trotts. Blend appears and tells them she overheard Paran and Trotts discussing how Trotts once held some kind of high Barghast rank and he’s going to try and get the White Face Barghast to ally with them against the Pannion, though it might involve Trotts having to do personal combat challenges.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Paran, looking at his group, recalls Whiskeyjack saying the Bridgeburners would be retired after the war, how rituals are needed to help usher the soldier back to the “normal” world, and wonders what “does he or she become?” He worries about what will happen when they meet the Barghast and thinks perhaps a quick death would be a blessing.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Quick Ben is moving through warrens, finding them “infected” and “corrupted.” He says it has the feel of the Crippled God but logic would argue it’s a defense by the Pannion, which leads him to think the two are connected. He shifts to Hood’s warren (or along the edge of it) and finds it is resisting the infection better. He comes across a bound sticksnare, the spirit (named Talamandas) of the White Face Barghast that Bauchelain and Korbal had loosed and then bound. Talamandas tells Quick Ben the necromancers would have dragged from him secrets of his people, such as that the Barghast came from the seas and were in fact once T’lan Imass that failed to arrive in time for the Ritual. Isolated, they changed. Quick asks what Talamandas would do if Quick Ben freed him and Talamandas says he would try to free the First Family spirits because the ancient bindings have kept them from ascending into true gods and thus the Barghast themselves are not changing/ascending, are stagnating since the ancestors cannot give them guidance; he wants to help the Barghast survive. Quick asks if survival is a right or a privilege and when Talamandas says the latter, Quick frees him.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Nine</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Toc and Envy’s group are nearing the border of the Pannion, the city of Bastion. Toc notes Envy is a bit different since she’s returned (after her discussion with K’rul, which Toc doesn’t know about). Envy mentions how the Imass have outlasted their gods and asks Toc how he imagines the afterlife. Toc wonders what the point is—the soul passes through and Hood or someone decides what to do with it. And Envy asks what if they do nothing with it, if it wanders purposeless. He answers the Imass seem to have a purpose—killing Jaghut. When Envy asks what if none are left, Toc says ask Tool. She says she did and he doesn’t know if any are left. She tells Toc to consider what would it mean for the T’lan Imass if the war is over and he thinks “A second Ritual of Gathering . . . an end to the T’lan Imass.” And Envy says, and what if no spirit waits to embrace those “weary” souls? Toc says he hopes she is wrong because Tool is his friend. Envy informs Toc that the Summoner of the Gathering is with the Malazan army, then implies they march toward a Jaghut: “like a white-hot knife through ice, we thrust to the heart . . . of frozen timeless soul.” A Kell Hunter appears and the Seguleh move to take it on, a test of their abilities. They, um, pass. Tool is shaken by Mok’s abilities, thinking he could not have done what Mok did, and he wants to challenge him immediately, as “the First Sword of the T’lan Imass must be without equal” (this coming after a conversation on “arrogance”). Envy puts Mok to sleep to forestall the duel.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>As they enter inhabited areas, Envy’s group takes steps to be less visible. Tool goes to dust and Envy casts illusions over the “dogs.”</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>They enter a temple inside the Pannion town. Inside they find bodies hanging from hooks. The priest tells them the temple master, Seerdomin Kahlt, awaits them, as does a dinner. Envy tells Kahlt the masked three are Seguleh, a name Kahlt recognizes. He considers them arrogant and says they’ll learn when they have to fight Seerdomin rather than unarmed priests. He asks if they’ve come to beg forgiveness and before Envy can answer, Toc replies they are seeking to deliver a message to the Seer in person. Kahlt says that may be allowed, but it’s not his call, and then leaves. Envy says they’ll probably be attacked at night. They’re escorted to their bedrooms and Toc falls asleep. He’s awakened by a scream and soon Baaljagg crashes in through the door. They’re joined in the hall by Garath and then eventually by Envy, who tells Toc Senu and Thurule are dealing with Kahlt and the soldiers that haven’t been taking care of yet while Garath will destroy the temple. Toc says the Seer will send an army after them and Envy says he’ll have to respond in some fashion. Toc says he doesn’t match up to this group, not being a Seguleh, a near-ascendant Ay, a dog that appears as strong as a Hound of Shadow, a T’lan Imass, or a witch. Envy almost compels him but decides against it. Tool appears and says K’ell Hunters are coming.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>They come to a crossroads and Envy gives a history mini-lesson based on the writing on the crossroads’ posts. She tells them the Pannion Domin seems to have been a colony of the Genostel archipelago, a group of seafarers halfway across the world whose “glory waned centuries ago.” Toc says they were clearly conquered and Envy says that’s always the way: “a civilization flowers, then a horde of grunting savages with close-set eyes show up and step on it. Malazan Empire take note.” Toc then quotes Kellanved’s words to “never ignore the barbarians,” then wryly informs Envy Kellanved was killed by a civilized woman with close-set eyes. They head toward Bastion. As they continue, Toc wonders how the Pannion is managing to feed their armies and expansion and cities with such an empty countryside. Envy says perhaps they’ll learn in Bastion. Toc challenges Envy for the real reason she’s doing what she’s doing and coercing/manipulating them all into joining her. She rejects that she is manipulating or coercing any of them and Toc doesn’t buy it, flustering her until she says “he’s just like Rake.” Pleased at having an upper hand for once, Toc relaxes and starts to relate his story, beginning with his birth, his mother being Cartheron Crust’s sister.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>They enter Bastion, which smells of death and fire and they realize the Pannion’s are eating their own dead. Three priests meet them and offer to guide them. They relate how Bastion was the site of the first “Embrasure” 14 years ago, where the Seer “returned from the Mountain, speaking the Words of Truth, and the power of those words rippled forward.” A caravan was killed (“rewarded”) and the first Child of the Dead Seed born nine months later—Anaster, who now leads an army of Tenescowri, along with his mother, toward Capustan. The group comes across Anaster and a mob and as chaos ensues, Toc leaves the group to “join” the Tenescowri since it’s heading for the Malazan army.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Ten</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Stonny slaps Gruntle awake out of a drunken stupor then tells Buke Gruntle is all his and leaves. Buke tells Gruntle he needs him. Gruntle asks how long he’s been drunk and Buke says six days and now the Septarch and Pannion army have crossed the river and it’s too late to leave the city. Buke says it’s time for Gruntle to sober up and grieve and when Gruntle says Buke is one to talk Buke replies he did his grieving long ago and it’s over, leaving nothing but “ashes,” and he adds that Gruntle isn’t like him. He challenges Gruntle as to what he will “carve out of” Harllo’s death, how will he make it have meaning? And asks if this is what Harllo sacrificed himself for. Buke says Hetan and Cafal have been hanging out with the Grey Swords and that he is still working for Bauchelain and Korbal. Gruntle appears “back.”</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>They head for the barracks and Buke tells Gruntle his bosses have taken ownership of an abandoned estate and that the killings have already begun in the city. Gruntle suggests telling the Prince, that such a thing during a siege will be even worse than normal, but Buke says he dare not. Gruntle says they have to be driven out and that Buke should just leave, maybe take Reese with him. Buke says the necromancers are too powerful, they’ll kill too many soldiers, wreck the city, leave it ripe for the Pannions. Though he thinks if the Pannions are the ones to rile them, then maybe the necromancers will turn on them instead. Buke thinks if he can shadow Korbal and keep him from killing, with Gruntle’s help, maybe they can finagle things to work out. Gruntle eventually says he’ll think on it, but Stonny can’t know anything about it or she’ll just try and kill Korbal and get herself killed. Buke says he knows a priest who can heal Gruntle’s hangover.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Itkovian awaits Brukhalian, Karnadas, Hetan, and Cafal to join him for a meeting with the Mask Council, requested by the Barghast. He has spent the morning viewing the besieging army and been shaken not only by the numbers but the savagery and horror of the Tenescowri. The others arrive. Hetan informs Itkovian she will “bed him,” but Karnadas tells her the Shield Anvil has taken monastic vows. They head through the prepared defenses toward the meeting. Brukhalian informs them that the T’lan Imass have said they will fight the undead K’chain Che’Malle but not moral humans. He anticipates the surprise Septarch Kulpath will find when his K’chain are taken out by the unknown T’lan. Brukhalian also says the alliance may prove temporary as the T’lan Imass may “find themselves directed to a new purpose” at the Gathering, and that the Summoner is with Brood’s army, about six weeks away. Itkovian says they cannot hold Capustan for that long. Brukhalian asks Hetan if the White Faces will ally, but she says they will not come to Capustan to fight. The Grey Swords ask why the Barghast have asked for this meeting and Hetan says it was the second of two tasks her group was set by her clan’s shouldermen.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>The 14 priests of the Council are awaiting the group. Hetan begins with “The White Faces are in mourning” and Rath’D’rek interrupts to say it’s a crazy time to come with the same claim that has already been rejected: “the answer was no the first time, no the second time, no every time!” Hetan and her brother bring magic and as guards reach for weapons, Karnadas warns them that the Barghast spirits are in the room. Itkovian tells Brukhalian that this is an “old petition,” that the Barghast claim this land under Capustan was once theirs. Hetan recaps the past reasons for rejecting their claim: early Daru records say the land wasn’t occupied, the oldest buildings were not Barghast-built, the Barghast lived in the north and only made rare pilgrimages to this area. She then recites the Barghast’s past responses: this was holy ground and the Barghast don’t live on their holy ground where their ancestors were buried, the early Capan tribes found only the Barghast barrows and built on top of them, the Barghast don’t expect the city to be removed but just ask that their claim of ownership be formally recognized and rights given to make pilgrimage. Hetan then says the Barghast’s patience is over, and now that the Pannion will seemingly take Capustan they have decided to act. Some of the priests realize that what Hetan is saying is that since the Barghast will not be able to make pilgrimages to their artifacts, she and her brother will move the artifacts to the Barghast. Itkovian and Karnadas realize that the bones Hetan seeks must be the remains of their mortal gods and that the Barghast themselves weren’t ever certain they were there until now. Itkovian also realizes Hetan’s father, Humbrall Taur, will need them to unify the clans to make war/defend against the Pannion, though Itkovian wonders how they will get them out of the besieged city. Rath’Queen of Dreams (who knows where the bones have been gathered) agrees to Hetan’s request and says they will be returned, though it will take some time to get to the resting place. Workers come in and start digging in the floor of the chamber, breaking through the stone floor. Meanwhile, the Council discusses tactics with the Grey Swords. Some think the fall of Capustan inevitable, some argue over holding the outer fortifications, some want to know of the undead Ay, of the two mages (the necromancers), of Keruli. Eventually they decide to postpone discussions due to the chaos of the digging. As they wait, Rath’Fener tells the Grey Swords he has gone to Fener’s realm and learned the Tiger of Summer is dead, though he cannot explain why Rath’Trake seems so happy. Karnadas says perhaps Trake is not so dead and Rath’Fener declares, “There is but one god of war!” then leaves. Karnadas tells Itkovian he has known of Trake’s death for some time and then asks Brukhalian for permission to declare himself and put Rath’Trake in his place, but is denied. The pit in the floor reveals buried outrigger ships, filled with bodies, both preserved by sorcery (tens of thousands of years old according to Karnadas). Rath’Queen of Dreams says many of the originally discovered dugouts disintegrated, but those ships and bodies not destroyed were gathered together: nine canoes and more than sixty bodies. She adds the scholars did not think the bodies were Barghast, they appear “almost Toblakai in stature” and she thinks the Toblakai, Barghast, and Trell are all from the same stock, “with the Barghast having more human blood than the other two.” Hetan confirms these are the Founding Spirits and Cafal says they are finding “their power.” Karnadas tells Itkovian “we are witnessing the birth of gods.” Itkovian asks Cafal how they’ll get them out of the city and Cafal says they don’t know yet. He says these were the first Barghast to come here and they have now ascended, so who now “dares challenge our pride?” Itkovian thinks, “That remains to be seen.”</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Stonny tells Gruntle he owes Keruli an apology and that Keruli pulled their souls into the Elder God’s warren (dreaming) so the K’chain thought they were dead, thus saving their lives. She tells him she was guarded by a giant wolf and when Gruntle asks “some kind of servant of the Elder God,” Stonny says he doesn’t have servants; he has friends. And that put her on his side. Gruntle agrees to go apologize but he won’t swear to him or his god. She takes him to K’rul’s new temple, a house sanctified by the blood of a family that committed suicide in it. They enter and Keruli says he has helped the souls to peace. Gruntle says thanks and is about to leave but Keruli says he has something for Buke, to help in his “endeavors.” It’s a little clay bird that Buke is to crush and mix with water then drink. When Gruntle says Buke will be skeptical, Keruli says tell him otherwise his quarry will escape him and that Buke needs to accept allies as must Gruntle, and that other allies “will find him [Buke].” Stonny asks what’s going on and Gruntle says it’s private then leaves. Keruli tells Stonny Gruntle will be walking a “difficult path” and that “his time is coming soon.” Stonny asks what she’s supposed to do about it and Keruli says to stay close to him.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Hetan, Cafal, and Itkovian are in the pit at the Council hall. Itkovian sees the ships are carved with pictures, some of the Barghast fighting “a tall, lithe species with angular faces and large, almond-shaped eyes.” Cafal calls them T’isten’ur, the “Grey Skinned Demons . . . who collected heads, yet kept the victims living . . . heads that remained watchful, bodies that worked ceaselessly . . . demons who dwelt in shadows . . . the Founding spirits . . . drove the demons back into their underworld, the Forest of Shadows.” Itkovian tells him of the Tiste Andii and “their shadow-kin, the Tiste Edur.” He notes the Barghast language is akin to the Imass and asks if Cafal understands Moranth. Cafal says the Moranth say they are related to the Barghast, call the Barghast their “Fallen Kin. But it is they who have fallen . . . who have found a shadowed forest in which to live . . . who have embraced the alchemies of the T’isten’ur.” He tells Itkovian to ask no more but Itkovian warns him the past refuses to stay buried and once opened it will bare unpleasant as well as pleasant truths. Cafal says Humbrall Taur has told them “in success, we shall find seeds of despair.” Hetan tells the Council they can recover the pit for now, that the removal will have to wait. Brukhalian tells Itkovian to keep an eye on the Barghast because he thinks they have a plan to remove the relics and implies Itkovian should use any method, including sleeping with Hetan. When Itkovian objects Brukhalian says this demand comes from Fener who is “filled with fear.” He then tells Karnadas to contact Quick Ben. Rath’Trake interrupts them and asks if they don’t wonder who “dares cross blades with our Lords . . . whose hidden face lies behind this fated ascension of Trake. What [is] the value of two gods of war? . . . . Why has Fener seen the need to revive that loftiest of positions [Destriant] now?” and says they can ask him for help if they need it. As Itkovian leaves, he thinks how the “earth has shifted” and all is uncertainty.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Eleven</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Picker and Antsy’s squad is bored and nervous and acting out among themselves. Picker is worried about Quick Ben being late, Paran being green, Whiskeyjack not around, and the lingering effects of what they consider betrayal at Pale. Blend tells her Dujek isn’t really outlawed and that WJ and Quick Ben probably are in on it. She points out Aranthos’ arrival coming right after the alleged outlawing and suspects he’s a high-ranking claw. Mallet has akin to a very bad sunburn due to the Crippled God’s poison in the warrens.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Quick Ben emerges from Hood’s warren after some difficulty. He suspects the Pannion Domin is a “feint” by the CG, that perhaps the Pannion Seer doesn’t even know he’s being used, is just a pawn.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Paran’s group is at the clan gathering of the White Face Barghast. Twist explains the Barghast hostility toward the Moranth is ancient and based on “false” memories. Trotts is making a claim to leadership and is going to face one of Humbrall Taur’s sons in one-on-one challenge. Paran thinks of Twist’s withered arm, ruined by a Rhivi spirit so that it will slowly kill him unless he gets “god’s healing touch.” Twist mentions Paran doesn’t appear well, but Paran dismisses it, then says he needs Twist to do something for him.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Paran looks at the crowd of Barghast before the challenge, noting Taur’s main rival Maral Eb of the Barahn Clan and the strangely armored Gilk. Corporal Aimless tells Paran some soldiers have some munitions ready in case things go bad and when Paran tells him to “stow it,” Aimless says they may just ignore Paran’s orders. Paran sends him back to the men telling them it’s a stupid idea. Trotts fights using Malazan tactics and weapons and wins, killing Taur’s son, but has his windpipe crushed. A healer, Mulch, performs a trach on Trotts and saves his life for at least a while. Paran has to tell a group of soldiers to stand down (they do) then converses with Humbrall Taur, who tells him he’s not sure what he’s decided yet (the fact that Trotts may still die doesn’t help). Twist arrives with Mallet (the favor Paran had asked earlier).</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Quick Ben is slowly recovering from the effects of Hood’s warren, thanks in part to the presence of the Barghast spirits which resist the Crippled God’s poison. The squad wonders what they’ll find when they arrive, having no news since Twist picked up Mallet. Quick Ben is suddenly pulled into the ground by hands and when Picker tries to grab him he tells her to let him go. Spindle says it was Barghast spirits. Picker decides to wait to see if Quick will re-emerge.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Quick Ben finds himself in a long-forgotten Barghast warren. The spirits are ancient, a mix of Imass and Toblakai before they became modern Barghast. Talamandas appears and tells Quick Ben Trotts won the challenge but may still die, which means Taur will probably kill the Malazans to get rid of the distraction while he has to deal with probably civil war among the Barghast. He points to the spirits and says while the soldiers are here, the warchiefs, the Founding Spirits are not, though they’ve been found by Hetan in Capustan. Talamandas tried to tell Taur but was driven away by the shouldermen, as they do with all ancient spirits, preferring the weaker, younger spirits who offer “comfort” rather than wisdom. Taur, he says, knows this is a problem, that the young spirits are too weak to resist the Pannion Domin and so the Barghast will be killed or enslaved. Talamandas asks Quick Ben to tell him the Founding Spirits have been found. Quick Ben asks that the spirits help Trotts survive by channeling his power through Mallet.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Mallet tells Paran he might not be much help due to his warren issues, but he’s willing to try though it will likely kill him. He goes to Trotts and opens his warren, giving up his own life force even as it begins to fade on him, but then he’s pulled by hands (the Barghast spirits) who tell him to “take from us . . . take our power.” And as they say, it is a “costly” path, for Mallet walks on a “carpet of corpses—his path through the poisoned horror of his warren.” He heals Trotts.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Paran is chewing himself up over ordering Mallet to his probable death: “who are you to balance lives? To gauge worth . . . this is a nightmare. I’m done with it.” Mulch tells him both Trotts and Mallet will live.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Mulch and Aimless watch Paran straighten himself and head for Taur’s tent and think he’s “cold as a Jaghut winter” and that he “might make it after all.” They spot Picker’s squad on the ridge.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>Paran tells Taur Trotts lives and is making his leadership claim. When Taur replies he “has no tribe,” Paran disagrees and says it’s the 38 Bridgeburners, a point Trotts made when he fought Malazan style. Taur says he understood that and warns that Trotts has never commanded, so Paran will need to watch him. Despite Trotts’ claim, Taur says the Barghast will not march on Capustan, the city that has taken so many Barghast youth: “Each year we lose more . . . their traders come among us with nothing of value . . . and would strip my people naked if they could.” Taur continues by explaining though he knows the Pannion will march on the Barghast, Taur can only hold eight of twenty-seven tribes. He adds the Bridgeburners are still in danger because some of the tribes are claiming they “cheated” basically by using necromancy to bring Trotts back to life and also because of general distrust due to the Malazans’ conquering ways and alliance with the hated Moranth. Paran leaves and Picker tells him Quick Ben hasn’t woken up since he returned from the Barghast warren. Paran tells them to get Mallet and goes to see Quick Ben. Mallet wakes Quick by slapping him. Paran fills Quick Ben in on everything and Quick says he can do something about Taur’s not caring about Capustan.</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>Blend and Picker watch the night’s craziness in the camp: sex and fights (some to the death). Picker’s torcs are getting hot, something it appears they’ve done before as she mentions regular dousings in a water barrel. Blend says the night feels strange and reminds her of when they’d stumbled into a “Rhivi Burn Ground” in the Blackdog Forest (or swamp?) and were saved by a wing of Black Moranth. Blend says spirits are loose tonight, ancestor spirits, not the “big ones” which makes her wonder where they are. Blend heads off and Spindle shows up saying it’s a bad night and that Paran and the others (Quick etc.) haven’t come out of Taur’s tent. Picker tells him to go off and have some fun and he says his Mother would be offended. When Picker says his mother is dead, Spindle appears to get whacked on the head by an invisible hand and Picker wonders if all the ancestors are out tonight, leading her to think to herself if “Da” shows up she’ll slit his throat like she did the first time.</p><p>SCENE 12</p><p>Paran steps from Taur’s tent thinking “the real battle is done” now that the Barghast spirits are awake. Quick Ben asks if Paran can feel the Elder Spirits and says the “Old Ones have joined with their younger spirit kin. The forgotten warren is forgotten no more,” adding this means the tribes will unite to free the gods in Capustan. Paran asks if Quick Ben knew the Moranth and Barghast were related and Quick says “more or less”, noting it doesn’t matter if the Barghast disapprove as the spirits have embraced Twist and the Moranth. When Quick mentions Paran will have to teach Trotts command/responsibility, Paran think he can’t do it himself: “I need only look into Whiskeyjack’s face to understand that no one can—no one who has a heart . . . We learn to achieve but one thing . . . to hide our thoughts . . . to bury our humanity deep in our souls.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Twelve</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Three weeks after he left Envy’s group and joined the Tenescowri, Toc reaches a mountain fort—Outlook—with the Tenescowri army. He has gotten the attention of the army’s leader, Anaster, and rides with his lieutenants at the army’s head. The army awaits the appearance of the Pannion Seer, who will bless them from a tower’s balcony at dawn. Toc thinks how the Seer must be feeling fear with the destruction Envy’s group is causing as they come closer. Toc is slowly starving to death as he refuses to turn cannibal. He wonders what drew Anaster’s attention and worries he suspects.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Anaster refuses his touch to all save his mother, whom Toc fears most of all, seeing something “demonic” in her eyes. Having seen them kill and then get the seed of the freshly dead, Toc thinks there is “some poison within the Seer and whatever god spoke through him. A poison that seemed born of familial memories…a child betrayed perhaps. A child led by the hand into terror and pain…” News arrives to Anaster that the siege is nearly complete around Capustan and the Tenescowri may arrive too late to “partake.” The Seer, though, has “gifted” them with the citizens of Coral, across the Ortnal Cut (a body of water). Anaster also says the Seer has demanded to see Toc, whom they call “The Defier”), noting as well that Toc’s eye has changed to a “wolf’s eye that so gleams in the dark.” Toc thinks he is going to his death and is relieved.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>On his way, Toc thinks of rumors he’s heard of Envy’s progress. Three pitched battles involving legions as well as Domin sorcerers haven’t stopped her group and resulted in thousands dead. He thinks he never would have survived.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Toc meets the Seer. He sees “a corpse, yet a creature dwelt within the husk, animating it . . . Tow beings, the living hiding behind the dead.” The Seer, meanwhile, tells Toc he has “a wolf’s eye in truth . . . More than a wolf’s eye that you see so clearly what no one else has.” The Seer questions how he, a Malazan, got separated from the northern army then asks if Envy’s group are friends of his. The Seer says he has heard Toc does not eat and he offers up meat to him as a test. Toc eats and the Seer tells him it is not human flesh, but venison, something Toc knew due to his wolf’s sense of smell. The Seer heals Toc and tells him that since mortal armies can’t defeat Envy’s group, he will “dismiss the enemy with my own hand.” Toc watches power build around the Seer, and notes it is cold and smells of ice.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Toc sees through Baaljaag’s eye. Tool is badly damaged. The ay feels the cold sorcery and it raises memories. Envy and Tool recognize the sorcery as well, and consider it “an imaginable alliance” between Jaghut and K’chain Che’Malle. Neither Tool nor Envy can defeat the sorcery. Sleet begins to fall.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Toc is back inside the tower. He sees the Jaghut inside the Seer’s body more clearly, and from it “grey roots roped down from the body’s legs, chaotic power, plunging down . . . twisting with something like pain or ecstasy.” Toc realizes the Jaghut is drawing on “another sorcery, something older, far more deadly than Omtose Phellack.” The Seer has sensed Toc’s linkage with Baaljagg and says, “the one within you readies for its rebirth . . . alas, the Beast Throne is vacant, neither you nor that beast god can match my strength.” He begins to scream, calling Toc a liar, and in that moment Toc sees him as a child. The Seer breaks his bones with sorcery than throws him someplace dark, where Toc is grabbed “in the yearning hug of giant, reptilian arms.” The Seer’s sorcery allows Toc’s bones to break and his body to tear but then it heals him so it can all happen again. The Seer speaks in Toc’s mind, telling him “You are worthy to take my place in that sweet motherly hug. Oh, she is mad . . . yet the sparks of need reside within her . . . beware or it will devour you as it did me—until I grew so foul she spat me back out. Need, when it overwhelms, becomes poison, Toc the Younger. The great corrupter of love, and so it shall corrupt you.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Thirteen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>The Mhybe is sitting in a wagon and thinking on the march, noting the Malazans “follow one man, and ask nothing of justification, or cause.” She wonders if they’ll follow Brood, “into the Abyss” then notes the Andii will certainly follow Rake into it, as will the Malazans behind Whiskeyjack and Dujek. Whiskyjack speaks with her and tells her they need her counsel, that she should tell him her nightmares. She tells him her enemy is death. When he starts to tell her he and she are too old to fear death, she interrupts and says she isn’t talking about Hood but what hides behind him: “not oblivion . . . a place crowded with fragmented memories—memories of pain, of despair . . . Love drifts like ashes . . . Even identity is gone . . . all that is left of you is doomed to an eternity of pain and terror—a succession of fragments from everyone—every thing that has ever lived . . . It is the true Abyss.” Whiskeyjack tells her perhaps it is her own imagination, that she is punishing herself “for what you perceive as your life’s failure.” It strikes her a bit home.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Whiskeyjack rides to join Dujek, Korlat, and Kruppe. He tells them the Mhybe is no better and has imagined a death that terrifies her. Korlat says Silverfox feels abandoned and bitter and is withdrawing. Whiskeyjack is feeling worn: his leg hurts, they haven’t heard from Paran and the Bridgeburners, they don’t know what is happening at Capustan, the warrens are impassable, Crone and the ravens are missing, the Trygalle Trade Guild is late with a shipment. Kruppe says the Guild will come through, no matter the cost. Whiskeyjack asks where Silverfox is, snaps at Korlat, then apologizes before heading to find Silverfox.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Whiskeyjack rides back to the rearguard where Silverfox is. Two marines are shadowing her, telling Whiskeyjack they’re doing so because she is Tattersail—“our cadre mage—and they guard her back as it’s a “fair exchange.” After they list all the ways they can kill/wound (including their teeth), Whiskeyjack surmises they grew up with brothers and shows them the scar from his little sister’s bite, “the first fight I ever lost.” When he joins Silverfox, who has overheard it all, she tells him “they’ll die for you now,” commenting on the way he binds his soldiers when he’s “being human.” She notes the similarity between them, both having ten thousand souls in their hands, and how that kind of pressure can “harden us a little more deep down.” When she says it makes “what was soft smaller, a little weaker,” Whiskeyjack says not weaker but “more concentrated, more selective” and that she feels it at all is a good sign it still exists. They’re interrupted by the appearance of the Trade Guild delivery, bringing a river of blood with them. Silverfox recognizes the blood as Krul’s, though she doesn’t name him, but says the blood belongs to “An Elder God’s. A friend’s.” The Trade Merchant, Haradas, says twenty or so demons tried to hitch a ride to get out of a “nightmare.”</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Kallor scorns the “fools [who] prattle on and on in the command tent” worried about the tainted warrens, thinking “order ever succumbs to chaos . . . The world will do better without mages.” He sits on an ironwood throne breathing in an alchemical candle, a “Century Candle” that keeps him alive, gives him another hundred years. He says to himself that no matter how long a stretch of time goes by where he does nothing, he must wait those moments when he must act decisively, explosively, and compares himself to a predator in his waiting stillness. He recalls the eight wizards that called down the Crippled God in opposition to Kallor, the three gods that opposed him and how he destroyed his own empire, leaving it ashes rather than give them satisfaction, for that “is the privilege of the creator—to give then to take away.” He knows K’rul is now in opposition again, but revels that K’rul has found another enemy (the CG) and it is killing him as Kallor predicted/cursed, just as his curse came true with Nightchill, though she tries to recover from it via Silverfox (something Kallor aims to prevent). His memories are interrupted by the appearance of Gethol, whom Kallor recognizes. Gethol tells Kallor he is now Herald in the House of Chains. Kallor mocks the idea, saying the new House will be obliterated, to which Gethol replies that the House is not only fighting but is winning. Kallor says the strategy makes no sense, poisoning the warrens, destroying the very power the Chained God needs. But Gethol says it isn’t really a poisoning but an “infection,” an attempt to cause an “alteration” so that while impassable to the CG’s enemies, his servants will be able to use them. He then offers Kallor the position of High King in the House. When Kallor says he will not bow to the CG, Gethol says the CG is trapped in his long-dead warren where he is chained, and so cannot influence the House of Chains directly, and so Kallor as King would have complete freedom. As Kallor considers it, Gethol says the CG wants to know where Rake and Moon’s Spawn have gone and Kallor says he requires a “moment of vulnerability” for Silverfox in exchange. Gethol says he’ll convey the message and departs. Kallor considers his ambush.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Fourteen</strong></p><p>OPENING</p><p>The opening gives a list of former role-holders in Fener’s Reve. The Last Mortal Sword was killed in the Chaining. The last Destriant was Ipshank of Korelri, who “vanished during the last flight of Manask.” Another is said to have been waiting to “claim” the title but was “cast out, ” his name “stricken from all records,” and the Fener’s Reve punishment doled out to him.</p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Gruntle is sitting in a bar. Buke arrives and tells him Keruli’s drink was helpful in his quest regarding Korbal and has “done wonders.” He tells Gruntle he’s told the Camp’s elders and dissuaded them from going to the Prince. Buke says he’ll still need Gruntle’s help and Gruntle says Buke knows where to find him when the time comes. He informs Gruntle that Stonny has volunteered to the defense force. Gruntle says she’s throwing her life away and when Buke says they’ll all have to fight eventually Gruntle says to himself “that’s what you think.” Buke continues by saying the only option is to switch sides and when Gruntle says “meat is meat,” Buke is shocked and disgusted; Gruntle tells him to get out of his sight.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Cafal and Hetan have been performing some sort of meditative rite for some time. Itkovian watches and thinks they are traveling among their spirits. He’s been tasked by Brukhalian to find a way through to see if they have a way out of Capustan, if there is a weakness in the city’s defenses or perhaps in the Pannion’s siege. Prince Jelarkan arrives and says he wants to know what the Grey Swords intend, what their “shaved knuckle in the hole” is, but tells Itkovian that Brukhalian won’t see him. He asks Itkovian why the T’lan Imass are not attack the Seer’s empire and thus force the siege to break. Itkovian tells the Prince the T’lan Imass have purposes unknown, including their mysterious Gathering which is going to take precedence over everything, and that they only destroyed the K’Chain Che’Malle because they might pose a threat to the Gathering. He also suspects that Kron is waiting for more T’lan Imass because they fear the Seer is a Jaghut. When the Prince asks why the Gathering is taking place here, Itkovian says because the Summoner is heading this way with an army commanded by Brood and Dujek, an army coming to attack the Pannion, though it will arrive too late for Capustan. The Prince is furious he hasn’t been told and when Itkovian says it doesn’t matter to the defense of the city, the Prince says he cares about the people not the city and suggests trying to punch a way out. Itkovian says they considered and rejected the idea as unworkable, and the Prince angrily says it is not their job to “do the prince’s thinking for him.” The Prince leaves and Itkovian notices that the Barghast have come out of their trance and that it had been a divination. As he watches, Cafal goes back into a trance. Itkovian “flirts” (badly) with Hetan, who sees through him: “you are clumsy. Yield to me and learn all my secrets, is that the task set before you?” Itkovian departs and Hetan is pleased at the game. As he walks away, Itkovian is tormented by his desire for Hetan, the “crumbling” of his vows. He feels Fener’s indifference and wonders if that is the real truth, that the gods “care nothing for the ascetic impositions on mortal behavior . . . perhaps they laugh at the chains we wrap around ourselves . . . or rage at us. Perhaps our denial of life’s celebration is our greatest insult to those we worship and serve.” Itkovian meets Karnadas and tells him he is beginning to doubt his vows. Karnadas says he is mistaken if thought his vows were to “appease Fener”—that his vows were a “dialogue with yourself, not with Fener,” and they will not be needed when “all that is encompassed by living ceases to threaten your faith.” Their discussion is interrupted by the beginning of the attack.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Gruntle finds Buke and tells him there’s movement from the besieging army. Buke says Korbal is “rattled” by his inability to find victims and says children are watching the house and keeping an eye “on the sky,” the latter part not seeming to make much sense and when Gruntle calls him on it Buke obviously lies. They hear an attack begin and Buke tells Gruntle he should go help Stonny. Gruntle says she put herself in danger, but then “somehow” ends up heading that way and then decides he may as well help pull her out if he’s going that way. He comes across a company of Grey Swords led by a Capan woman who tells them they’re going to hold the gate for the sortie to return. The defenders return with an attack just behind them. Stonny arrives in a squad, bloody, wounded. She tells Gruntle “A Seerdomin found me . . . but the bastard left me alive. I hunted him down . . . it [begging] didn’t work for me, why should it have for him?” Gruntle realizes she was raped. He tells her he’ll take her to a clean room and guard her. He carries her away and thinks later he’ll kill thousands of the enemy in retaliation. As he walks off, he feels his muscles fill “with a strange unyielding strength” and the scene closes with saying there would be no words “to describe what he would become, what he would do.”</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Itkovian oversees the defense. He watches the Gidrath hold for a long time in the outer fortification, blocks of the city catch fire, etc., but the defenders hold. Karnadas tells him Brukhalian has been summoned to the Thrall’s main hall, where Hetan and Cafal have taken up residence. He heals Itkovian’s exhaustion than goes to tell Brukhalian that Itkovian has not found how the Barghast intend to save their founders’ remains. The assault continues.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Karnadas arrives at the Masked Council just in time to see Keruli enter and demand the right to address the Council as Rath’K’rul, and to hear him say one of the Council will betray everyone.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Gruntle tries to comfort Stonny. She tells him to go kill some Pannions. He tells her to take her time healing and leaves.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Itkovian sends out a sortie to destroy the siege engines. He is told lots of enemies have been killed at the North Gate, killed by an “impromptu militia” commanded by an unknown citizen (Gruntle), who has taken them off to kill more Pannions.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>After Keruli’s words, Karnadas immediately suspects Rath’ Fener. When Rath’Shadowthrone says K’rul’s age is “long past,” Keruli replies that K’rul has returned, which should relieve them as it is his blood that is being poisoned. He continues that the coming battle threatens even their gods and they should check with their gods if they doubt him, though they have little time. Rath’Queen of Dreams wonders if he is spreading divisiveness with the claim of betrayal, but he says the innocent will unite and the guilt most likely be handled by “his god,” Brukhalian leaves with Karnadas. Hetan asks Keruli if his god’s offer of aid was true and Keruli says yes, asking which of them will volunteer. She points to Cafal, who is seemingly asleep and Keruli warns everyone not to wake him, “if you value your lives.”</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Gruntle leads his motley company, helped by a Lestari sergeant. They relieve a siege of a building then are distracted momentarily by a glow coming from the Thrall. Gruntle then leads them to the West Gate, where defenders are retreating.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>Itkovian stresses over the failure of the West Gate to hold, but then is surprised when its defense suddenly stiffens. A messenger arrives and tells him the West Gate had fallen, all was slaughter and chaos when a foreigner (Gruntle) led a company in, commandeered folks, and shamed the Tular Camp into fighting by holding up the corpse of a child the Pannions had begun to eat. He then took the child’s tunic and fastened it into a standard and led them to relieve defenders and slaughter the enemy. The messenger left as they were about to attack through the West Gate, and he tells Itkovian the foreigner fought “like a boar.” Another messenger brings news the Tenescowri are on the move and will be there at dawn. Itkovian orders the citizen taken below into the tunnels. Karnadas tells Itkovian the glow from the Thrall is from Cafal, Hetan, and a new priest—the merchant rescued on the plains days ago. They then connect the “foreigner” to the merchant’s caravan guard.</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>Gruntle kills the last of the opposing soldiers (for the moment). He realizes with a shock that it appears he’s lost none or almost none of his people. He tells them to grab the army from the dead enemy then they’ll withdraw.</p><p>SCENE 12</p><p>As they reenter Capustan, a Grey Swords officer tells Gruntle they’ve set up weaponsmiths to sharpen his “tusks” (his twin cutlasses). When she takes offense at how lightly he takes the reference, he tells her they’ll call them “tiger-claws” rather than tusks. A messenger (actually, Itkovian in disguise, come to meet this “foreigner” and take his measure) arrives from Itkovian and tells Gruntle about the citizens being brought to the tunnels and that there are stores there and defenses to hold for two or three weeks. The soldiers, he says, will fight house by house, street by street, and so Itkovian wants to know what section Gruntle would like and if he needs anything. Gruntle says he’ll take the North Gate area and use the tenement building where Stonny is to fall back to. As they finish, Gruntle’s lieutenant (the Lestari sgt. has been “field promoted”) tells Gruntle the weaponsmiths are ready to sharpen his “tiger-claws,” and Itkovian reacts strongly (though Gruntle doesn’t see).</p><p>SCENE 13</p><p>As Gruntle leaves, Itkovian thinks he is no boar but instead “a big, plains-hunting cat . . . The Tiger of Summer’s ghost walks in this man’s shadow. He realizes that Treach is ascending and wonders what it means for Fener, and thinks “Fener descending . . . on this our last day.” The Tenescowri begin to move toward the city.</p><p>SCENE 14</p><p>Buke makes his way to the necromancer’s estate. As he arrives, a Shadow priest is leaving, furious as being kicked out with “a boot to the backside” and though Buke says he should just let it be, the priest heads off muttering. Buke meets Bauchelain inside the gates amid 10 or so Urdomen corpses that Bauchelain says Korbal will “recruit.” He informs Buke the Tenescowri are coming and says Korbal can’t wait to examine Anaster, the First Child of the Dead Seed. Suddenly, the Urdomen corpses rise and Bauchelain tells Buke they will be guards and suggests where to deploy them. Reese rushes out and feels the chest of one of the corpses and is shocked there is no wound because, he says, Korbal has their hearts all sewn together on the kitchen table. Bauchelain says Korbal has been forced to “modify his habits” due to Reese and Buke’s interference, and now Korbal doesn’t need to leave the house for his “acquisition.” He adds that they should stop interfering and then warns Buke not to use Keruli’s “peculiar sorcery now residing within you . . . we dislike company when in our Soletaken form.” Bauchelain leaves and Reese asks what Keruli has done to Buke and he answers he can follow them now. He looks up to see two rooks on the rooftop and when they take off (heading for Anaster he believes), he veers himself into a sparrow hawk. Reese watches him follow thinking he can follow but is no match for the two’s sorcery.</p><p>SCENE 15</p><p>As Buke looks down on the Tenescowri, he thinks: “The Pannion Seer is a monster in truth. A tyranny of need . . . Defeat him? You’d have to kill every man, woman, and child on this world who are bowed to hunger . . . this is simply the heart. It will spread. It will infect every city . . . devour empires . . . We are all lost.” His thoughts are interrupted by sorcery as he sees the rooks attack Anaster, using magic and demons to deal with the Tenescowri. They are driven away by opposing magic and he watches them retreat, getting hammered as they do so. He races back to the estate, returns to human form, and order the undead guards to their positions. The rooks land in disarray and reform, their armor tattered and themselves showing blood and bruises. Buke asks what happened and Bauchelain says, “It seems we must needs refine our tactics.” Buke laughs and Bauchelain heads inside.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Fifteen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Whiskeyjack comes to the edge of a mesa and looks down into a riverbed where he sees part of his army moving through a field of huge bones, among them blades and iron. As he gets closer, he sees the remains are reptilian. The Rhivi scouts tell Whiskeyjack the undead demons came from the southeast (they mention Morn), fleeing big undead wolves, “like the ghost-runners of our legend. When the eldest shouldermen or women dream their farthest dreams . . . all ghostly save the one who leads, who seems as flesh and has eyes of life.” The scout says the undead wolves destroyed the demons. Kruppe, Korlat, and Silverfox arrive. Korlat identifies the bones as K’Chain Che Malle K’ell Hunters and Silverfox identifies the killers as T’lan Ay. The Ay arrive in thousands. Silverfox calls them her escort, Whiskeyjack knows (and knows Silverfox knows) they are a bodyguard as well, thinking this means she no longer needs the Malazans’ protection—“she is free to do whatever she pleases.” He worries for a moment over the idea that Kallor might be right, then shrugs it aside as an “unworthy” thought, thinking she, or at least the Tattersail in her, will remember they showed faith in her when it was most needed. He wonders if Nightchill’s soul hates Tattersail or the Empire (and all of it) or Rake/Brood and their allies. Silverfox asks Korlat about her mother and she answers that the Mhybe has been unable to walk for a week and suggests Silverfox see her, but Silverfox says there is no need. Korlat says Coll and Murillio are taking care of her and Silverfox warns things are about to get “tense,” and asks Korlat to assign Andii to guard her mother. When Korlat points out the Ay, Silverfox says her mother won’t let them approach her due to her nightmares. Korlat agrees and leaves. Silverfox asks Kruppe if he is satisfied and he says yes, and says he has faith the Mhybe will hold on. The Ay descend back to dust at Silverfox’s command so nobody else sees them. Whiskeyjack worries about all the secrets in the two armies, as well as over what is going on with Quick Ben and Paran and the Bridgeburners. Kallor arrives with Brood and Dujek, Artanthos, Haradas, and the vanguard. He joins them and doesn’t tell them of the Ay. When he mentions the K’Chain, Kallor says the remnants of their civilization are on nearly every continent. He says they are reptilian and can breed for specific purposes—such as making K’ell Hunters. They are matriarchal and matrilineal, and he compares them to a hive and a queen bee, saying within the Matron lies the sorcerous power of her whole family, “power to beggar the gods of today. Power to keep the Elder Gods from coming to this world,” adding were it not for their civil war they would still be ruling. He said the Matrons, seeking more power (why is not clear) had resurrected an older breed, bringing them back from extinction—the Short-Tails (Korlat reacts strongly to this name). He said it appears the Short-Tails refused to meld or surrender their magic to the Matrons and thus civil war broke out. To see one result, he says one can go to Morn/the Rent, which is where one Matron tried to “harness the power of a gate . . . open [ing] a portal that led to the Realm of Chaos.” When Brood wonders what the undead K’ell are doing here, Silverfox says they are being used by the Pannion Seer. Kallor says that is impossible because only a Matron can command a K’ell Hunter, which means, Silverfox says, they also have a matron to deal with as an enemy. Kallor says without any living male K’Chain, the Matron cannot breed more Hunters. Silverfox says the T’lan Imass have destroyed the Hunters and Kallor asks why, why have they joined this war. Silverfox says they haven’t joined anything and to explain, goes back to why the T’lan Imass warred with the Jaghut. She tells them when the first Imass appeared, they were tolerated by the Jaghut, “pushed to the poorest of lands”, but then Tyrants rose and enslaved them and many generations of them, in a “nightmarish existence.” She says the lesson was that “there were intelligent beings . . . who exploited the virtues of others, their compassion, their love, their faith in kin.” She says many Imass found out their “gods” were actually Tyrants “hidden behind friendly masks . . . who manipulated them with the weapons of faith.” Rebellion, she tells them, was inevitable and it devastated the Imass. When Kallor says there were only ever a “handful” of Tyrants among the Jaghut, she answers that was still too many, and admits that other Jaghut helped the Imass. But now, “we carried scars . . . of mistrust, of betrayal. We could trust only in our own kind. In the name of generations to come, all Jaghut would have to die. None could be left, to produce more children, to permit among those children the rise of new Tyrants.” Korlat interrupts to ask what all this has to do with the K’Chain Che’Malle. Silverfox says the KCM ruled before the Jaghut, and as the first Imass were to the Jaghut, the first Jaghut were to the KCM. She adds, “in each species is born the seeds of domination. Our wars with the Jaghut destroyed us, as a living people, as a vibrant, evolving culture. That was the price we paid, to ensure the freedom you now possess. Our eternal sacrifice…” and points out this army is also waging war and sacrificing against a tyrant, for people that know nothing of them. She says the Pannion Domin must be destroyed—that is their task, but her job (and that of the T’lan Imass) is to destroy what lies behind it: A KCM Matron. Kallor says she is lying, that this whole war is a “feint,” but refuses to explain when Dujek asks by whom. Haradas says there may be some truth to it, and points to the warrens being poisoned by chaos, which leads to the question of why a Matron, the sole repository of magic that gives her power, would want to destroy it. Not to mention, if it’s the same Matron as created the Rent, why would she use Chaos again? Whiskeyjack realizes who is behind this, and also that he and Dujek were among the last to figure it out. He asks Silverfox if she and the T’lan Imass will help against this “third hand.” She says no, it would be too much. The idea of something that makes the T’lan Imass “recoil” terrifies Whiskeyjack and Dujek.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Kruppe interrupts and says he places himself in the path of that enemy. That is too much for Brood, who dismounts and says give proof of how he plans to do so or else, and he reaches for his hammer. Kruppe seems to provoke Brood further, until Brood strikes the ground before Kruppe with his hammer. The shock wave throws everyone down (including the horses) and causes an avalanche. Whiskeyjack watches, stunned, as hills on the other side of the valley rise through the ground forming a new mountain range. The mesa top on which they stood has been mostly destroyed, while a fissure in the earth has formed running through the valley. Kruppe is still standing before Brood and Whiskeyjack thinks they now have proof of Kruppe’s power and he wonders who the demonstration of power was for. As they look down, they see the fissure is filling with “fouled blood” and they all realize Burn is dying, poisoned.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>The Mhybe is awakened by Brood’s hammer blow on the earth. She thinks of the torture of being young in her dreams, and wonder who the strangers are in that tundra land, strangers she feels are stalking her like hunters and whom she flees always. Coll and Murillio discuss Kruppe’s escape from Brood’s wrath, and how Brood nearly didn’t escape the wrath of Kruppe’s mule, which they say is a “strange one indeed . . . so watchful. Of everything.” As they talk, the Mhybe bitterly thinks how she was truly a mere “vessel” for Silverfox, that though Silverfox has multiple souls in her (“two women, and a Thelomen named Skullcrusher”), she has nothing of the Mhybe. Thinking she’s asleep, Coll and Murillio discuss their grief over her fate and how the copper ornaments Kruppe gave her get brighter when she sleeps. She fades back into the dream-world.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Dujek bursts into the tent and tells Whiskeyjack he didn’t sign up for a war against a god. Whiskeyjack tells him not to fight him then, let the various ascendants who seemingly already knew about the Chained God do it. He points out as well that he and Dujek are hardly ones to complain about secrets and manipulations, and finishes by saying he has faith in Kruppe. When Dujek seems skeptical, Whiskeyjack reminds him that Brood certainly took Kruppe seriously. And because of that Kallor now must take Brood seriously. And then he says the whole time they were in Darujhistan—“our grand failure”—Whiskeyjack had felt there was someone behind the scenes “orchestrating the whole thing.” Then, Kruppe is involved in Silverfox’s birth, an Elder God returns, as do the T’lan Imass . . . Whiskeyjack posits that Kruppe manipulates “circumstance . . . I don’t feel we are fated to dance as he wills. There is an Elder God behind the Daru, but even there, I think it’s more an alliance of mutual benefit, almost between equals. A partnership . . . this time it [manipulation] feels different, less inimical . . . I sense compassion this time.” When Dujek wonders what Kruppe is, Whiskeyjack says he thinks he’s merely mortal, but blessed with “an intelligence that is singular in its prowess . . . the greatest of minds.” As further evidence, he reminds the still skeptical Dujek that it was Kruppe who brought in the Trygalle Trade Guild, found the First Rhivi ornaments to give to the Mhybe, is the only one Silverfox will open up to, has set himself against the Crippled God, and was protected by K’rul when Brood’s hammer struck. Dujek finally buys it, but says he worries about not being “actively engaged” against the CG, and Whiskeyjack says he suspects Quick Ben has been, Quick Ben whom he calls only a “very short step” behind Kruppe, the “world’s foremost genius.” They are interrupted by the arrival of Twist.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Korlat enters Whiskyjack’s tent furious and demands to know his secrets: “about Tattersail reborn, about those damned T’lan Ay, about what you’ve instructed those two marines guarding the child to say to the Mhybe.” Whiskyjack tells her he’s given them no instructions at all (not even to guard Silverfox), but if they’ve said something bad he’ll take responsibility. Korlat calms a bit, then asks him why Silverfox insisted the Mhybe not know of the Ay. Whiskeyjack says he has no idea, but thought Korlat knew. She takes this in a moment, then asks if he was planning on confronting her about the secrets he thought she was holding and he said no. She pauses, then asks him to clean the scratches from the Mhybe, telling him she thinks she made a terrible mistake, despite good intentions, which he says often happens with good intentions. Korlat says she’s realized she and the others have all underestimated the Malazans, thinking them convenient weapons of mere soldiers but that in fact they have become “our backbone. Somehow, you are what gives us our strength, holds us together.” She adds she does know they’re keeping secrets and Whiskeyjack tells her the biggest is that the Malazans feel “outmatched . . . We don’t have your power. We’re just an army. Our best wizard isn’t even ranked. He’s a squad mage . . . . [we’re] bowed, brittle.” When Korlat says she doubts it he insists he isn’t being merely modest. Korlat muses that Silverfox is manipulating the Mhybe, maybe even giving her the nightmares and when Whiskeyjack doubts it, she says he may be giving too much credit to Tattersail’s personality. He admits it’s possible Nightchill feels betrayed, and Bellurdan, but he thinks Tattersail would resist them and is still prevalent in Silverfox. Korlat calls him a rare man and they share a romantic moment that closes with Whiskeyjack’s unstated fear of losing her.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Kruppe speaks with the two marines guarding Silverfox, says Whiskeyjack must be happy with their reports that Tattersail seems preeminent in Silverfox. On the subject of Whiskyjack, they tell Kruppe WJ should have been emperor but Laseen knew him as her main rival and so stripped him of command/rank and sent him away. When Kruppe calls Whiskeyjack “ambitious,” they scorn the thought and say that’s the point—his lack of ambition is why he would have been a good Emperor. When Kruppe asks why Whiskeyjack didn’t just take the throne, they reply it was because he knew it might lead to civil war and collapse, so he’d given Laseen a chance to keep things together. Kruppe leaves and the marines discuss that they think he and Silverfox are up to something regarding the Mhybe.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Kruppe speaks with Murillio and Coll. They tell him the Mhybe is a tragedy and he says “matters of vast mercy are in progress,” but the Mhybe isn’t ready yet to be told: “this is a journey of the spirit. She must begin it within herself.” Coll asks how he avoided being killed by Brood and Kruppe says “rage has no efficacy against [Kruppe] for whom the world is nestled as a pearl within . . . the confines of his . . . brain . . . for whom the world is naught but a plumage dream of colours and wonders unimagined, where even time itself has lost meaning.” He leaves.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Crone flies overhead. She recognizes the touch of chaos, of the Crippled God, within the blood in the fissure created by Brood—the blood of Burn. She reports to Brood that Rake has “succeeded. Moon’s Spawn has passed unseen and now hides.” She adds her children have passed over the Seer’s land and she herself visited Capustan and determined it cannot hold. She surprises him with information that the Seer is fighting on a second front to the south and is losing, though he has now employed Omtose Phellack against whatever foe it is routing his armies. Brood says he and Rake suspected the Seer’s non-human nature, and tells Crone they didn’t want her getting too close. She says she couldn’t get very close to Outlook anyway due to the condors, which are not “entirely mundane.” She leaves after tweaking Brood for losing his temper with Kruppe.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Sixteen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Itkovian and the Grey Swords fight the Tenescowri and Itkovian is horrified by how the Tenescowri rape and feed on the dead, as well as by how he and his own are slaughtering these unarmed, untrained peasants. He is impaled by a pike in the back and a broken-off knife blade in his knee before fighting free and reaching the just-arriving reinforcements led by Brukhalian and Karnadas. Itkovian asks Karnadas to heal his men and horse then slips into unconsciousness.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Gruntle and his squad fight in another part of the city, retreating into a building and filling it with the dead. His forearms have taken on a “strange pattern of blood stains, barbed and striped, the blood blackening and seeming to creep into his skin.” The same stripes “spread away from his eyes and bearded cheeks. Tawny amber streaked the beard itself. His eyes were the colour of sun-withered prairie grass.” His cutlasses have also changed, “were yellowed white—fangs in truth now.” Stonny is fighting with them now, her pain “the debt he had only begun to pay.” His Lestari lieutenant “knew . . . he and the rest of the militia now existed more within the mind of Gruntle than they did in the real world. They fought with skills they had never before possessed. They did not tire.” The Lestari tells Gruntle, “You are Trake’s Mortal Sword.” Gruntle ignores the comment and asks if Stonny is okay. They continue to retreat up floor by floor.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Brukhalian watches as the cutters and Karnadas work to save the wounded, noting Karnadas has gone “too far” and how his body is now showing its “irreversible surrender,” and he knows Karnadas will be dead by dawn. The Grey Swords have been nearly totally destroyed in the defense and he acknowledges that Capustan has fallen. A messenger (the recruit with Itkovian when they met the K’Chain Che’Malle) arrives with a communication from Rath’Fener via an acolyte saying the Thrall is under attack and the priest is invoking the Eighth Command, demanding Brukhalian ride to his succor. Brukhalian is suspicious about how the acolyte managed to get across the city, then asks the messenger if she will join them. He then changes his mind and tells her to stay and guard his horse and then to “inform the Shield Anvil of my disposition when he awakes.” When she wonders what he means, he says she will know soon. He collects 400 soldiers, nearly all that is left of the Gray Swords and they head off, many of them knowing as he does that they are not meant to return, that they have been betrayed by Rath’ Fener. A suspicion Brukhalian confirms with a veteran, who says they should not go. Brukhalian tells him the priest’s crime will be answered, but not by them for if they do not go there is no crime. When the veteran looks forward to when Fener punishes the priest, Brukhalian corrects him, saying “our god shall not be the one . . . this is a betrayal that wounds him deeply, leaves him weakened and vulnerable to fatal consequences . . . our vengeful hand shall be Itkovian.” They enter the Thrall area and are cut down by archers lying in wait.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Itkovian wakes and in his mind sees the scene at the Thrall, as after the archers foot soldiers attack the Grey Swords. Brukhalian’s sword burns with black fire that consumes the Pannion soldiers even as Brukhalian is wounded beyond mortal wounds, until he finally dies and it explodes, killing even more. As Brukhalian’s corpse drops to its knees, Hood appears “to greet this man’s soul. In person.” Then he disappears and it begins to rain. Itkovian feels Rath’Fener’s eyes sharing this same vision and he tells him “You are mine, betrayer. Mine.”</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Buke flies over the city, numbed by the horror below. At the necromancers’ estate, the Tenescowri have been repeatedly turned back by the animated corpses and other sorcery. He sees a single building filled and surrounded by the dead, surrounded by fire yet not burning, the walls weeping blood, and Gruntle and his squad on the roof where their child’s tunic standard flies. He thinks of Gruntle: “A terrible transformation . . . one more victim of this siege.”</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Itkovian comes fully awake, only partially healed. Karnadas is next to him, dying. The recruit messenger tells him there are 137 Grey Swords left, 96 of them recruits, and their barracks is fallen and burning. Karnadas dies. The messenger requests to be punished for bringing Rath’ Fener’s traitorous message. Itkovian tells her Brukhalian well knew what he was doing. As she leaves, Itkovian says, “I am not yet done.”</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Itkovian prepares the surviving Grey Swords for a march to the palace. He gives Brukhalian’s warhorse to the recruit.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>As they approach the palace, Itkovian feels some shame that Brukhalian had asked for six weeks and had gotten only three days. They enter into the main hall where Tenescowri are feasting, including Anaster and his mother. Near the throne, the Prince’s skin is stretched out on an x-shaped cross made of pikes. Anaster tells him the Prince was already dead—”we are not consciously cruel”—and says this must be Itkovian. He tells him they have figured out the population is hiding in tunnels and the Pannions are searching for them. Itkovian tells him he sees Anaster’s despair and will take it from him. When Anaster questions him, the Grey Sword captain explains: “Fener knows grief, so much grief that it is beyond his capacity to withstand it. And so he chooses a human heart. Armoured. A mortal soul, to assume the sorrow of the world. The Shield Anvil.” Anaster refuses and Itkovian realizes Anaster has nothing but despair; without it “he is as nothing.” Battle breaks out and the Seerdomin are killed as the Tenescowri flee. Itkovian commands the Prince’s skin be taken down and he will be returned to the throne. He says he will meet Anaster again-“I am his only salvation, sir, and I shall not fail him . . . I am the world’s grief. And I will hold. I will hold it all, for we are not yet done.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Seventeen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Toc is fevered and delirious in the cave and clutches of the K’Chain Matron. He dreams of wolves, “hunting, not to feed, but to deliver something else . . . the quarry fled when it saw him . . . as they closed in to deliver . . . the quarry vanished.” Meanwhile, the Matron is always breaking his bones when embracing him, bones which heal quickly though not evenly so he is malformed. He’s also visited by the Seer who gives him news that Envy’s group is trapped, “swallowed in ice,” while the Malazan army is too late and Capustan fallen. Then later, the Seer comes and says his defenses are being sorely tested—“they are not mortal beasts”—so they are leaving, heading north. Toc shifts to a POV outside the city as Envy’s group attacks and he watches Tool, Baaljagg and Garath defeat Kell hunters, and Garath get badly wounded but then he’s ripped out of the vision as the Seer takes him and the Matron via warren from Outlook to Coral. Envy assaults the warren and Toc blacks out.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Paran looks over Capustan from a hillside. He sees it fallen and thinks only the Crimson Guard might have made a difference, that otherwise “mercenaries were less than worthless.” He hopes Humbrall Taur’s children are still alive. Trotts arrives and Paran tells him it could be worse—there’s fire but no firestorm and Trotts says the Bridgeburners saw one in Seven Cities once. Trotts describes Taur’s plans for disposition of the clans and tells Paran Hetan and Cafal are alive, the bones protected by sorcery. When Paran chafes at the pace, Trotts says he has been given leave to lead his “clan” at his own speed and so the Bridgeburners will be first into the city. Paran thinks how his pain is worse—he’s throwing up blood now—and also how he has been pushing away Silverfox’s questing thoughts. They prepare to enter with the 37 Bridgeburners.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>The Bridgeburners edge up to the city, Paran once again pushing away Silverfox’s presence, though he is beginning to wonder if it is indeed Silverfox he feels. They prepare to punch through a group of infantry with Spindle leading the sappers in their use of munitions. After they use cussers, Paran runs with the squad toward the city, horrified by the devastation: “The hand of vengeance stayed cold only so long. Any soul possessing a shred of humanity could not help but see the reality behind cold deliverance, no matter how justified it might have at first seemed . . . Destroyed lives. Vengeance yielded a mirror to every atrocity, where notions of right and wrong blurred and lost all relevance . . . we are their match in calculated brutality.” They enter the city and seeing the cost of the siege to the Pannions, Paran thinks “I should revise my estimation of the Grey Swords.” They head toward the glowing Thrall, having to climb a slope of corpses to pass one street. As Paran thinks how the Grey Swords have humbled the Bridgeburners with the evidence of the courage and unyielding nature, they realize the slope of bodies was constructed as a siege ramp, ending just below the roofline of a building. Gruntle calls down to them and when Hedge says “I like the paint,” referring to Gruntle and his squad’s stripes, Gruntle says it isn’t paint. As the Malazans climb to the roof via ladders Gruntle’s squad sends down, Paran notes that Picker is in pain, but she says Mallet can’t help her when Paran suggests it. On the roof, Gruntle tells Picker she has something for him and he reaches out for her torcs, which she says have been getting tighter and tighter. She tells him Treach is insane and Gruntle says he is dead and ascended into godhood. He takes the torcs and puts them on. Paran, looking at him, thinks “A beast resides within him, an ancient spirit, reawakened,” and notes that Gruntle is a combination of himself and Treach, not merely a vessel: “[Gruntle’s] power . . . was born as much from a natural air of command as from the beast hiding within him—for that beast preferred solitude. its massive strength had somehow been almost subsumed by that quality of leadership. Together, a formidable union.” He also realizes Gruntle is important and Paran meeting him “is no accident.” Gruntle tells them Stonny is dying in a tent and when Mallet goes to heal her, Paran warns him how the last time almost killed him. But Mallet says the Barghast spirits are helping him, that “someone’s taken a personal interest.” As he communes with the spirits he speaks of how Stonny has wounded flesh and spirit and he’ll need to heal both, then comments on how the Barghast spirits will sacrifice so many to save her. He then mentions “threads” that the spirits see in her, Gruntle, and Paran, but says he cannot see them. Mallet and the spirits heal her to Gruntle’s shock.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>The White Face defeat the Pannion reinforcements and enter the city, routing the Tenescowri and pressing back the Pannion rearguard. Picker watches from the rooftop, wondering about the others, if they’re even alive. She thinks Paran’s condition doesn’t bode well. Stonny arrives and asks Picker if she is sworn to Trake, because of the torcs. Picker says no and realizes what has Stonny confused is how Gruntle ended up transformed into what he is. Gruntle says she doesn’t recognize him, he’s “cold, inhuman” like a tiger. Picker points out he fought for Stonny, but Stonny says that was just his excuse. Picker says it isn’t just Gruntle but his men as well, and says Treach may have shaped all this and Picker had a role to play as well. Stonny says she won’t worship Trake; she’s sworn to another god. Picker says maybe Stonny’s god found it all useful: “We [humans] ain’t the only ones who sometimes walk in step, or even work together to achieve something of mutual benefit—without explaining a damned thing to the rest of us . . . It’s deadly attention when it’s a god’s.” Saying that makes her realize others are keeping secrets and she asks Paran if he’s heard from Silverfox. He says she’s alive and that confirms Picker’s suspicion and she thinks it is a bad decision: “the last time us Bridgeburners was kept in the dark, that dark swallowed damn near every one of us.” He tells her Dujek and Silverfox are only three leagues away and they know the Pannions are being driven toward them. Picker wonders how tight the bond is between Paran and Tattersail and why he’s kept it secret. She’s angry as is Antsy who upbraids him “speaking for all the Bridgeburners” because they’ve been fighting and dying and not knowing what was happening with the rest, and if Paran had been killed they would not have known at all. Antsy draws his sword and when Picker tells him to stop, Paran says “I’ll make it easier” and turns his back on Antsy. Picker is horrified that Paran is hurting so bad he wants to die. Mallet tells Antsy to stop and Picker yells at him for also keeping secrets, as he spent a lot of time talking with Quick Ben. Mallet says Paran has been pushing Silverfox away so they aren’t actually talking like Picker thinks, and she’s wrong if she thinks the Bridgeburners are being singled out for betrayal again; Paran simply isn’t talking to anyone, “and if you had as many holes burned through your guts as he does, you’d be pretty damned tight-lipped yourself.” Picker realizes she screwed up.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Paran is barely paying attention, “assailed by the pressure of Silverfox’s presence.” He wants to die, wants it over. He feels her close and senses her power, “that was so much more than just Tattersail. Making its relentless desire to break through his defenses much deadlier of purpose . . . This isn’t Tattersail at all. It’s Nightchill. Bellurdan. One or both.” Suddenly he has a vision of a card—Obelisk—”a leaning monolith . . . now of green stone. Jade. Towering above wind-whipped waves—no, dunes of sand. Figures, in the monolith’s shadow. Three . . . Ragged, broken, dying. Then, beyond . . . the furred hoof of a god stepped onto mortal ground. Terror. Savagely pulled into the world . . . Fener was as good as dead . . . like a babe on an altar. All that was required was a knife and a willful hand.” He wants to step away from the knowledge, from the “choices being demanded of him.” He realizes that as Fener has fallen, another has been pushed into his place, “mortals sworn to one, swear them now to another? Are we to be shoved—flicked—around like pebbles on a board?” He grows angry and his anger drives his pain away: “you wanted my attention. You’ve got it. Listen and listen well, Nightchill—whoever . . . Maybe there have been Masters of the Deck before . . . whom you could pluck and pull to your bidding. Hood knows, maybe you’re the one—you and your Elder friends—who selected me . . . But if so, oh, you’ve made a mistake. A bad one. I’ve been a god’s puppet once before. But I cut those strings . . . ask Oponn . . . I walked into a cursed sword to do and I swear I’ll do it again—with far less mercy in my heart—if I get so much as a whiff of manipulation.” At first he senses amusement from the presence, but his anger at that response draws out the beast/hound in him and the amusement quickly changes to alarm. He tells it “I’m taking a step forward. Between you and every mortal like me. I don’t know what that man Gruntle had to lose, to arrive where you wanted him . . . is pain your only means of making us achieve what you want? . . . until you can show me another way—something other than pain or grief—I’ll fight you. We have our lives . . . and they are not for you to play with. Not Picker’s life, nor Gruntle’s or Stonny’s.” He threatens Nightchill (assuming it’s her) with him riding down their connection with the blood of a Hound of Shadow and also with calling the rest of them along: “because in the sword Dragnipur, two Hounds of Shadow returned to the Warren of Darkness. Returned Nightchill. Do you grasp my meaning? They were going home. And I can call them back . . . Two souls of untamed Dark.” Nightchill finally answers him, telling him he has “no idea what you threaten . . . My brother’s sword hides far more secrets than you can comprehend.” But Paran tells her, “Worst than that Nightchill. The hand now wielding Dragnipur belongs to Darkness. Anomander Rake . . . the pathway has never been so straight, so direct . . Should I tell him what happened . . .” When she says Rake would kill him Paran says don’t be so sure and then demands she show him this vast struggle she says justifies their treatment of mortals and when she says it would drive him insane he calls her a “patronizing bitch.” Angered, she tells him he’s so sure the gods only use pain, but “appearances deceive. When he mockingly asks if keeping mortals ignorant is supposed to be mercy she says yes, actually. But, he says, the Master of the Deck cannot be ignorant. She answers “in time” they will. He asks who she means and she answers herself, K’rul, “the surviving Elder Gods,” but not Draconus, who can now only “act indirectly, for he is chained within the very sword he created.” Paran realizes he spoke to Draconus in Dragnipur and Nightchill tells him Draconus has been changed by his time in the sword; his cruelty has been “blunted.” When Paran asks if she wants him to free Draconus she says yes and when Paran says he wouldn’t do that and let Draconus go after Rake for the sword, she says Draconus will not battle Rake for Dragnipur since to free Draconus the sword must be shattered. Paran says no way, since that would mean freeing everybody in the sword, but Nightchill says he needn’t decide now, and Draconus may have to figure out some way to not allow the rest out. She tells him they are not as cruel as he thinks and he says he’s skeptical of that claim and thinks she wants vengeance still. She agrees, but says only against “the one who voiced” her ancient curse (Kallor). He asks what Nightchill has done with Tattersail and she says nothing; “we shall not harm her . . . there is honor within her. And integrity.” The conversation breaks off suddenly as Mallet puts his hand on Paran’s shoulder, saying they’d thought they’d lost Paran there. Paran orders them to the Thrall. Gruntle is going with them.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Itkovian stands atop the palace tower, exhausted, knowing the battles are winding down and the Pannion will soon be driven fully off. The Capan recruit, Velbara, is with him. Itkovian says they will head for the Thrall. He wonders at how a surviving Gidrith, “sworn to Hood follows my command.” And he feels something has happened, leaving him feeling hollow and “incomplete . . . as if I had surrendered my faith . . . I am . . . emptied as if I await renewal.”</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>As they prepare to head out, Itkovian listens to the silence of the city and thinks “Dear Fener, find for me the victory in this . . . a city has been killed.” As they move through the corpse-strewn streets, he muses on how “what the Pannions had delivered had in turn been delivered upon them. We are all pushed into a world of madness, yet it must now fall to each of us to pull back from this Abyss . . . From horror, grief must be fashioned, and from grief, compassion. They meet a group of Barghast also heading to the Thrall, who praise Itkovian for the strength and bravery of the Grey Swords. As they walk, Itkovian notes Gruntle’s building and how it hadn’t been touched by fire and realizes it is packed (literally) with dead. The Barghast leader says they fled from it, and that the only similar thing they’d come across was an estate guarded by animated corpses. Itkovian thinks how “The Reve of Fener voiced the truth of war. It spoke true of the cruelty that humanity was capable of unleashing on its own kind . . . insisted the glory to be found was not to be a blind one, rather a glory born of solemn, clear-eyed regard.” Regard, he thinks, that is failing him, though he swears to himself he will assume the burden. he would redeem the dead, though he worries that his redemption can only come from his god but he cannot find Fener, his realm “seems empty.” And he wonders “who will embrace me?” They enter the plaza and meet the Bridgeburners and Gruntle’s group also coming. Itkovian realizes at the sight of Gruntle that “we are replaced.” The Masked Council and Keruli appear as well. Gruntle tells Itkovian “it is done,” but Paran says not so fast, that while the Grey Swords have lost their god, a “path has been prepared.” He is interrupted though by the appearance of Humbral Taur. Before Paran can continue, Itkovian tells him to wait so he can punish Rath’Fener. When Itkovian says he will invoke Fener’s Reve, the priest says only a Mortal Sword can and Gruntle, who knows of the betrayal, says he’ll do it then. Rath’Trake tells Itkovian that without Fener, the punishment will be especially harsh and suggests mere execution. But Itkovian refuses, though Rath’ Trake says “his soul will be torn apart. Where they (the priest’s hands) will go, there are no creatures of mercy.” Itkovian cuts of Rath’ Fener’s hands, which disappear. Paran says with Fener gone, “he cannot bless you. With what you take upon yourself, there is nowhere for it to go, no way to ease the burden.” Itkovian says he knows. Paran continues that there is another way though, and Rath’ Trake says the Tiger of Summer will welcome them, but Itkovian says no. Paran says this moment was foreseen by Elder gods and they would want the Grey Swords to do this, but Itkovian refuses, saying “I am not yet done.” Rath’ Fener’s body suddenly spasms and “alien script swarmed his flesh as the unknown claimant made its mark, claiming possession of the man’s mortal soul. Words that darkened like burns.” The priest is being tortured, his skin boiling, but he is not dying. Itkovian steps forward and asks the priest if he will accept Itkovian’s embrace and Rath’ Fener, knowing what that would mean to Itkovian, pulls away out of mercy, but Itkovian picks him up: “I see you recoil and know it for your final gesture. One that is atonement . . . I assume your pain . . I free your soul to Hood, to death’s solace.” All of the priest’s life goes before Itkovian’s vision so that Itkovian understands him fully and he takes his pain and grief but “suddenly, beyond the pain, a mutual awareness—an alien presence, immense power. Not malign, yet profoundly different. From that presence, confusion, anguish. Seeking to make of the unexpected gift of a mortal’s two hands something of beauty . . . yet that man’s flesh could not contain that gift. Horror within the storm . . . and grief.” And so Itkovian opens himself to take that presence’s grief as well: “even gods weep. Commend yourself then to my spirit. I will have your pain.” But it is too much for Itkovian: he felt his soul dissolving . . . there was, beneath the cold faces of gods, warmth. Yet it was sorrow in darkness, for it was not the gods themselves who were unfathomable. It was mortals. As for the gods—they simply paid. We [mortals] are the rack upon which they are stretched.” The alien god manages to extract itself but Itkovian is still overwhelmed by Rath’ Fener’s pain and the pain of the entire city “as his embrace was forced ever wider . . . Not one he would turn away. Souls in the tens of thousands, lifetimes of pain, loss, love, and sorrow . . . Memories of piteous, pointless ends . . . I must atone. I must give answer to every death . . . to free the souls to find their way to the feet of countless gods, or Hood’s own realm, or indeed to the Abyss itself . . . Reach gods! Redeem them, sir [Itkovian]! you are the bringer of peace, the redeemer of the fallen. . . without you death is senseless and the denial of meaning is the world’s greatest crime to its children.” The others watch as Itkovian is overwhelmed, as he drops to his knees, stops breathing. Paran shakes him and Itkovian draws breath again, “such weight! Why? God, you all watched. You witnessed . . . but did not step forward. You denied my cry for help. Why?” Paran tells him he can feel it; the city has been “cleansed.” And Itkovian thinks “I am not yet done.”</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>As Gruntle watches, he feels the fog that has been around him lifting and notes how he has changed. He is terrified by the coldness of the killer in him, and tells Trake “you could’ve at least asked.” He recognizes his group are now followers, “sworn” to him, but is thankful Stonny is not, sworn to Keruli’s god instead. Stonny fills him in on what’s been happening and mentions she’s surprised at him, as she never took him for the worshipping type. He says he isn’t and Trake made a bad choice. When she assumes Buke is dead, Gruntle points out the sparrowhawk overhead and explains. They’re interrupted by Rath’Trake who is shocked and disturbed by Gruntle’s noted lack of reverence for their god—Gruntle calls him the “Whiskered One” and says he’ll be the Mortal Sword as a “hobby.” Paran overhears and laughs: “it never goes how you think it should, does it priest? That’s the glory of us humans, and your new god had best make peace with that.”</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Blend tells Picker what seems to have happened and says Paran’s power and attitude will be good for them. Taur and Trotts and the Barghast begin moving to the Thrall’s gate to meet their gods.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>The sparrowhawk watches everything, sees the Pannions retreating, the city being slowly cleaned up, Barghast heading to the Thrall. It keeps its distance, which is what keeps it sane, “vast dramas of death and desperation were diminished almost into abstraction . . . the sheer muddiness of humanity, all diminished, the futility reduced to something strangely manageable. Burned out buildings. The tragic end of innocents. Wives, mothers, children . . . No closer. Ever again.” It heads further skyward—”there was pain the gifts of the Elder Gods. But sometimes, there was mercy.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">Quick Ben awakens after days. Talamandas says Quick was raving at times and had talked of opposing the Crippled God and trying to save Burn. Talamandas says he is impressed by Quick’s “integrity.” He catches Quick up on the Capustan events and then asks how Quick plans on taking on the CG without his powers. Talamandas says he and his gods can help, that they are willing to make sacrifices to “armour” Quick from the CG’s poisons; Talamandas will be his shield, impervious as he is to the CG’s poison. When Quick Ben warns him he may take odd paths and won’t waste time explaining, Talamandas says the Barghast gods trust him “because they like you . . . in your fevered mind you revealed the way your mind works—you wove a net, a web, yet even I could not see all the links . . . your grasp of causality surpasses my intellect . . . Perhaps my gods caught a glimmer of your design . . . triggering an instinctive suspicion that in you, mortal, the Crippled God will meet his match.” Quick Ben agrees to the alliance and asks if Talamandas knows who it is that Quick has sensed “shaping its own opposition to the Fallen One.” Talamandas says there are some Elder Gods, but that their response is “reactionary . . . a kind of fighting withdrawal. They seem incapable of changing the future, only preparing for it.” When Quick says that seems pretty “fatalistic,” Talamandas replies that has always been “their perennial flaw.” The scene ends with Quick musing that “it’s not really their battle. Except for maybe K’rul . . . “</span></p><p>SCENE 2</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">Talamandas asks what Quick knows of K’rul and Quick responds that he knows K’rul made the warrens and that all who used magic “swim his immortal blood.” Talamandas is stunned by Quick’s knowledge: “no-one knows all about that! No one!” Quick continues with “K’rul is in even worse shape than Burn . . . makes that fatalism a little more understandable. And . . . all the last surviving Elder Gods have lived under a host of nasty curses for a long, long time . . . Your Barghast gods aren’t ready to go it alone . . . The Elder Gods have been on the defensive—tried to go it alone— . . . but that wasn’t working, so they’ve gone looking for allies . . . who was at work refashioning you into something capable of shielding me in the warrens? Hood, for one, I’d imagine . . . And Fener’s thrown you a bone, or Treach, or whoever’s on that particular roost right now—you can hit back if something comes at you. And I’d guess the Queen of Dreams has stepped in, a bridge between you and the Sleeping Goddess . . . so you’re all ready to go, but where? How? And that’s where I come in.” Talamandas admits they’re all relying on Quick to do “whatever it is you’re planning to do,” which Quick acknowledges but then he refuses to say just what that might be. The two exit the tent and Talamandas tells Quick the Bridgeburners are still at the Thrall probably. He also says the Barghast are no longer fighting amongst themselves as much since the gods have spoken to the shamans, and that the Barghast will march south against the Pannion with the others. Quick Ben says it’s time to contact his allies in the western army.</span></p><p>SCENE 3</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">The Malazans break the Pannions. A messenger tells Whiskeyjack that Brood has won the south flank, Septarch Kulpath (the Pannion leader) was killed, and the Barghast and Rhivi have broken their opponents as well, with help from the Tiste Andii who took out a Mage Cadre. Whiskeyjack tells the messenger to inform Brood that 200,000 Tenescowri remain nearby, but that he and Dujek do not want “an unmitigated slaughter of these peasants.” Korlat appears out of a warren and says she needs Whiskeyjack to come to Dujek’s command tent.</span></p><p>SCENE 4</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">At first it is full dark in the warren (Kurald Galain—warren of Darkness), but then a grey sliver appears and Korlat warns that the fact that the CG’s poison affect even Kurald Galain “does not bode well.” Whiskeyjack asks what Rake is planning to do about it and what’s taking so long, and Korlat responds “we’re a patient people” and says he’ll act at the “propitious moment.” Whiskeyjack says, like how he’ll use Moon Spawn against the Pannion Seer, and she replies yes. When Whiskeyjack says Korlat seems to have a lot of faith in Rake, she clarifies it is more like certainty based on prior action than faith. And then, when Whiskeyjack asks how she feels about him, she says he is also comforted by certainty there as well, comforted actually in “every facet of that question.” She wants to know if she should ask him the same and he says she shouldn’t have to, but the answer is the same. They step out of the warren in Dujek’s tent to find Quick Ben waiting. He tells Whiskeyjack that he (Quick) can travel the warrens safely now, the White Face Barghast hold Capustan, the Barghast will march with them against the Seer, the Bridgeburners are fine and at the Thrall with Humbrall Taur and survivors, including a few Grey Swords, whom he says acquitted themselves unbelievably. Whiskeyjack says they’ll get there after figuring out what to do about the Tenescowri army and Quick Ben relates the atrocities that army was involved in, mentioning specifically that their leader Anaster skinned the Prince and ate him in the throne room. Whiskeyjack says any who can be charged and convicted of such crimes will get military executions, a punishment that Quick Ben points out is far more mercy than what the Tenescowri showed to their victims. Whiskeyjack agrees and says it’s lucky then for the Tenescowri that the Malazans captured them. Quick, though, says he is worried about how the surviving populace will react to such mercy, then leaves. Korlat says Kallor will not like this, but Whiskeyjack doesn’t think Brood will care much what Kallor says. When Korlat says horrors to answer horrors is an ancient law, Whiskeyjack says he “doesn’t hold to it . . .We become no better then.” As he speaks of the logistical difficulties in dealing with the Tenescowri, Korlat realizes he actually would rather just leave the Tenescowri. When she asks, Whiskeyjack senses something else behind the question, “the whisper of a hidden wedge, poised to drive itself between us.” He answers they’ll take the leaders, including Anaster, but the “real criminal” is the Seer, “who would starve his followers into cannibalism, into madness. Who would destroy his own people. We’d be executing the victims—</span>his victims.” Korlat points out that would argue for forgiving the Pannion armies as well, and Whiskeyjack answers that he and Dujek agree that “we are not here to annihilate a nation. The armies that impede our march to the Seer will be dealt with. Efficiently. Retribution and revenge are distractions.” Korlat wonders “what of liberation?” and Whiskeyjack says that’s “incidental,” and then he expresses surprise, saying it seemed Brood saw it the same way when they planned to “strike for the heart.” But she says he misunderstood, that “for over a decade the warlord has been waging a war of liberation—from the rapacious hunger of your Malazan Empire. Brood has now shifted his focus . . . is here to free the Pannions.” Whiskeyjack responds you can’t free people from themselves and she answers Brood means to free them from the Seer’s rule, to which Whiskeyjack says “who exalted the Seer to his present position?” Korlat expresses confusion then, saying “yet you speak of absolving the commonality, even the soldiers of the Pannion.” And Whiskeyjack tries to clarify by saying “neither I nor Dujek will willingly assume the role of judge and executioner should we prove victorious. Nor are we here to put the pieces back together for the Pannions . . . [to do that means] we must occupy.” Korlat laughs at that and says “is that not the Malazan way?” Whiskeyjack objects that “this is not a Malazan war” and when Korlat says “Isn’t it?”, he tries to use the “we were outlawed” cover story but realizes Korlat knows (or suspects) that isn’t true and that “he had just failed a test. And with that failure had ended the trust that had grown between them.” Korlat walks out after giving him a smile of “pain and regret.”</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">After she leaves, Whiskeyjack thinks to himself “Should I have told you, Korlat? . . . That we’ve got a knife at our throats and the hand holding it on Empress Laseen’s behalf is right here in this very camp and has been ever since the beginning.” Dujek enters and Whiskeyjack immediately tells him Brood knows the Malazans aren’t outlawed. They both realize coming clean now is a bit of an insult. Just as Dujek says “the alliance is in trouble,” Artanthos interrupts to tell them Brood is calling a counsel. </span></p><p>SCENE 6</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">The Mhybe reflects on how the wagon bed has become her whole realm. She thinks of how the Nathii bury their dead in wooden boxes similar to the wagon bed. She feels dead, awaiting an end, but is upset others won’t let her end it: “They were keeping it away. Playing out their own delusions of mercy and compassion . . . Gestures of malice . . . scenes of torture. The Rhivi woman who takes care of her is brain-injured and the Mhybe thinks how before the woman became her caretaker she had helped prepare the corpses, and wonders if she even knows the Mhybe is alive (the Mhybe also considers it malicious to have put this woman as her caretaker). As the woman sings, the Mhybe believes she does so to keep away the terror she must feel, surrounded by “unknowns, amidst things she could not comprehend.” The Mhybe thinks she would rather live in this woman’s world of terror than face “my daughter’s betrayal—the wolves she has set upon me, to pursue me in my dreams. The wolves, which are her hunger . . . There have been no rituals severing our lives—we have forgotten . . . the true reasons for those rituals. I ever yield. And you suckle in ceaseless demand. And so we are trapped, pulled deeper and deeper.” She begs the spirits to kill her, to end this “cruel parody of motherhood,” the bitterness of hating one’s own child, of “remain[ing] a young woman in this aged body.” The caretaker accidentally hurts the Mhybe while brushing her hair and when the Mhybe hisses in pain and looks at her, their eyes meet: </span><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">“</span><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">The woman who looked at no one was looking at her.

Silverfox asks about how her mother is doing and Kruppe suggests she ask herself, but Silverfox says she cannot, that she is nothing but “an abomination for my mother—her stolen youth in the flesh.” She tells him things are worse since Korlat told the Mhybe of the Ay and Kruppe asks if Silverfox is beginning to “doubt the journey undertaken.” Silverfox answers it is too late for doubts; theirs (her and Kruppe’s) journey is done and it’s now up to the Mhybe to make hers. Kruppe objects that Silverfox is lying; “your journey is anything but done,” but decides to let it go. He asks of the battles and she summarizes events, ending with Brood’s call to counsel. Kruppe says he’ll attend but when asked, Silverfox says she has other things to deal with. They are about to part when she says she now has a “sudden urge” to go with him to the meeting, a “part” of her wishes to though she can’t tell which part of her it is (Tattersail, Bellurdan, Nightchill). Kruppe suggests she goes, for “if a rift is imminent, your personage could prove essential, for you are the bridge.” She says she doesn’t trust Nightchill and he says most people have parts of themselves they don’t trust (save him of course).</span></p><p>SCENE 8</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">Rake enters Brood’s tent where Korlat, Brood, and Kallor await the Malazans. Korlat says the alliance is at risk and Kallor complains “we’ve been lied to from the very start” and suggests attacking the Malazans immediately, while they’re still recovering from today’s battle. Rake ignores Kallor and tells Brood if he’s talking about the fact of “the hidden hand of the Empress—the daggers poised behind the backs of Dujek Onearm and Whiskeyjack,” then if the allies do intervene, it should be to help them, unless Brood suddenly thinks them incompetent militarily, which today’s battle would seem to belie. Kallor says nobody questions their ability, but “this was to be a war of liberation.” Rake says “don’t be a fool” and Brood replies it isn’t so foolish a statement. But Rake interrupts “the Pannion Domin is just another empire . . . and represents a threat. Which we are intending to obliterate. Liberation of the commonality may well result, but it cannot be our goal.” He goes on to defend the Malazan Empire: </span></p><blockquote><p>The Domin is an empire that sows horror and oppression among its own people . . . consider those cities and territories on Genabackis that are now under Malazan rule. Horror? No . . .Oppression? . . . Malazan laws are, if anything, among the least repressive of any empire I have known. Now. The Seer is removed, a High Fist and Malazan-style governance replaces it. The result? Peace, reparation, law, order . . . Fifteen years ago, Genebaris was a fetid sore on the northwest coast, and Nathilog even worse. And now, under Malazan rule? Rivals to Darujhistan herself. If you truly wish the best for the common citizens of Pannion, why do you not welcome the Empress? . . . Brood, you and I, we have fought the Malazans as liberators in truth . . . Our motives aren’t even clear to us—imagine how they must seem to the Empress? Inexplicable. We appear to be bound to lofty ideals . . . We are her enemy, and I don’t think she even knows why.</p></blockquote><p>When Kallor responds that there wouldn’t be a place for any of them in the Empire, Rake says of course not, “We cannot be controlled. The truth laid bare is we fight for our own freedom. No borders for Moon’s Spawn. No world-spanning peace that would make warlords and generals and mercenary companies obsolete. We fight against the imposition of order and the mailed fist that must hide behind it, because we’re not the ones wielding that fist.” When Brood points out he has no desire to do be the fist, Rake asks, “then why begrudge” the ones who do? Korlat is stunned but incredibly proud of Rake: He is the Son of Darkness. A master worth swearing fealty to—perhaps the only one. For me. For the Tiste Andii.” Brood simply sighs and asks for a drink while Kallor says he’ll hold back his “disgust” and discuss the logistics of the march to Coral, suggesting the army split and march as two parts. Rake says now that makes a sensible subject for the meeting and Brood dryly mentions how surprised the Malazans will be by the choice of subject. Korlat thinks she has done Whiskeyjack a disservice and hopes she can make up for it. The Malazans enter and Dujek apologizes for being late, saying he was just told the Tenescowri are marching toward them, preparing for a battle at dawn. Rake says “leave that to me.” When Dujek asks if Rake means to send the Andii against the Tenescowri, Rake says “Hardly . . . I mean to scare them witless. In person.” Brood then pours drinks and says they have another issue, dragging it out humorously (to those who know) so Whiskeyjack and Dujek continue to think it’s about their lie. Korlat refuses to let them dangle, so brings up the march and division of armies. Whiskeyjack and Dujek are a bit confused, but Whiskeyjack offers up his view on the division, which he says is complicated by the Barghast joining, the possibility that some Capustan forces will want to join, as well as by the possible presence of Silverfox and the Imass. Kallor spits out “If we allow the bitch and her T’lan Imass into this war . . . we will have lost all hope of guiding it.” Whiskeyjack says his “obsession” is “twisting” Kallor’s mind. Kallor answers “And sentiment has twisted yours soldier. Perhaps a day will come when you and I can test our respective resolve.” Brood interrupts and says we can decide disposition when all the commanders are present. He then asks Rake about Moon Spawn and Rake says “We will rendezvous at Coral as planned,” and adds that a mysterious force at least partially made up of a T’lan Imass, a she-wolf, and a “very large dog.” is assailing the Seer from the south and that the Seer has fled to Coral. When the Malazans suggest the Imass must be a Bonecaster, Rake says no, he is a warrior with a sword and Bonecasters do not carry weapons. He also tells them the wolf might be an Ay and the dog “rivals those of Shadow.” They all realize that this means when they get to Coral they will face the Seer himself and the battle will be “fraught with sorcery.”</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">Silverfox and Kruppe, on their way to the meeting, sense the “storm” has passed. Silverfox says she’ll go deal with her own business now and asks Kruppe not to tell anyone of her departure for a while. Kruppe asks if the Gathering has come and she says yes and she wants it to be private. Kruppe asks if he can come and she agrees. When his mule arrives, she wonders “who else will be witness to the Gathering through you?” He swears only him. When Silverfox asks about the mule, he says the mule will merely sleep through it, and Silverfox’s answer is “Sleep is it? No doubt, to dream.”</span></p><p>SCENE 10</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">Rake asks Whiskeyjack to walk with him after the meeting. Rake asks about his leg and when Whiskeyjack admits it hurts, Rake says Brood would heal him, to which Whiskeyjack gives his usual response: “when there’s time.” Rake points out there has been plenty of time, but moves on. He’s happy to hear Whiskeyjack has heard from Quick Ben, and even happier to see Whiskeyjack’s effect on Korlat: “I had not expected to find in her such renewal. A heart I’d believed closed for ever. To see it flowering so . . . ” When Whiskeyjack worries out loud he may have wounded her with his deception, Rake says only momentarily. He says he defused the anger and Whiskeyjack eventually figures out Rake and the others still need the Malazans. Rake admits perhaps more than ever and says they need pretty much everybody, including Paran as Master of the Deck. Whiskeyjack asks what that role means and Rake explains “The Crippled God has fashioned a new House and now seeks to join it to the Deck of Dragons. A sanction is required. A blessing . . . or conversely a denial. Whiskeyjack wonders who blessed the House of Shadow then, but Rake says “there was no need. The House of Shadow has always existed, more or less. Shadowthrone and Cotillion merely reawakened it.” When Whiskeyjack asks if Rake means for Paran to deny sanction to the CG’s House, Rake says “I believe he must. To grant the Fallen One legitimacy is to grant him power. We see what he is capable of in his present weakened state. The House of Chains is the foundation he will use to rebuild himself.” Whiskeyjack points out that Rake and the gods “took him down” before via the Chaining, but Rake replies that it was “costly” and that Fener, who is now “lost to us” was vital in that Chaining. When Whiskeyjack asks how Fener was lost, how he was as Rake described “torn from his realm [into] the mortal earth,” Rake says “by a Malazan.” He goes on to explain in detail:</span></p><blockquote><p>A once-priest of Fener . . . his hands were ritually severed. The power of the Reve then sends those hands to the hooves of Fener himself. The ritual must be the expression of purest justice, but this one wasn’t . . . there was a perceived need to reduce the influence of Fener, and in particular that High Priest, by agents of the Empire—likely the Claw . . . the High Priest’s penchant for historical analysis was another [factor]—he had completed an investigation that concluded that the Empress Laseen in fact failed in her assassination of the Emperor and Dancer . . . [who] ascended . . . in any case, those severed hands were as poison to Fener . . . He burned the tattoos announcing his denial upon the priest’s skin, and so sealed the virulent power of the hands . . . eventually the priest would die, and his spirit would come to Fener to retrieve [the hands]. That spirit would then become the weapon of Fener’s wrath, his vengeance upon the priests of the fouled temple, and indeed upon the Claw and the Empress herself . . . but . . . the High Priest has, by design or chance, come into contact with the Warren of Chaos—an object, perhaps forged within that warren. The protective seal around his severed hands was obliterated . . . and finding Fener, those hands, pushed. . . and now the Tiger of Summer ascends to take his place. But Treach is young, much weaker, his warren but a paltry thing, his followers far fewer in number.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p>When Whiskeyjack says Trake’s ascension is a heck of a coincidence, Rake says the Elder Gods foresaw at least some of this and were involved because “The Fall destroyed many of them, leaving but a few survivors. Whatever secrets surround the Fallen One—where he came from, the nature of his aspect . . . —K’rul and his kind possess them. That they have chosen to become directly involved . . . has dire implications as to the seriousness of the threat.” Whiskeyjack says he now understands Rake’s suggestion re Paran’s sanctioning (or not), but warns him Paran “doesn’t take orders well.” Rake asks Whiskeyjack to help convince him and Whiskeyjack says he’ll try. Rake asks then if Whiskeyjack ever finds the voice of river to be “unsettling” and when Whiskeyjack says he finds it calming instead, Rake says “this points to the essential difference between us,” which Whiskeyjack takes to mean between immortals and mortals. He suggests some drinking and Rake thinks it’s a good idea. Whiskeyjack hopes the ale will allow Rake to “find the voice grown calm” but as he looks at Rake, with Dragnipur on his back “like an elongated cross, surrounded in its own breath of preternatural darkness,” he doesn’t think the ale will work.</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">Quick Ben prepares to enter a warren, with Talamandas riding his shoulder. He enters Rashan and moves toward an estate, which Talamandas recognizes as belonging to the necromancers who ripped him out of his barrow. Quick Ben says he wants to talk to them “to take their measure.” He also wants to test Talamandas’ ability to protect him from the CG’s poison. He tries to decide between using Hood’s warren or Aral Gamelon, a demonic warren, as he senses both kinds of sorcery in the estate. He chooses Hood’s warren and sees all the deaths of the city, piled and layered for generations. He realizes though all he is seeing are echoes, that the dead have been taken through Hood’s Gate, “blessed . . . their pain ended.” As they move to the estate, they are challenged by a chained Sirinth demon which Quick offers a deal to: he breaks its chain and it leaves peacefully. As he examines the chain, he finds it curious it is in High Korelri script. He frees the demon and escapes its attack, as well as that of the undead guards. Quick uses the D’riss warren (Path of Stone) to enter the estate building. He comes to a room where Bauchelain is reading in a chair, Reese is tending a fire, and Broach in rook form is on the mantel. Bauchelain makes it clear he knows there is a visitor in the house and Quick Ben steps out of the wall to face him. Bauchelain tells Reese to get wine for him and his guest and offers Quick a seat, which he takes. Bauchelain is impressed Quick freed and then escaped from his demon, mentioning he never frees his demons, which shocks Quick somewhat. Bauchelain says “I hold no sympathy for mere tools.” Reese returns with drink and two glasses and when asked, says he tried some down below to make sure it was “flowery” as Bauchelain ordered. When he says it was “thick . . . like iron,” Bauchelain sniffs it and tells him it’s blood from Korbal Broach’s “collection.” Reese, nervous, asks whose blood and after Quick explains to him why Reese thinks it important, Bauchelain sniffs again and guesses virgin blood because “it’s woody.”</span></p><p>SCENE 12</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">Paran examines the Barghast canoes in the Thrall. He is coming to understand his pain finally: “He was not a aman who welcomed power, but it had been thrust upon him . . . knowledge of the inter-connectedness that bound all things and everyone to everyone else . . . an adjudicator. A mitigator of power whose task was to assert a structure—the rules of the game—upon players who resented every challenge to their freedom . . . pressured by every influence imaginable . . . transforming even the easiest and most straightforward of decisions into a a nightmare.” He thinks how Gruntle has struck up a seeming friendship with Hetan, which he thinks they’re acting on now, “much to the disgust of the woman Stonny.” Itkovian has led his troop to the barracks to prepare for tomorrow’s retrieval of the underground refugees and Paran thinks it will take some time and doing for Capustan to recover. As he thinks on the apparent fragility of the Deck, and then on Treach’s ascension and Gruntle, he suspects the “Elder Gods had not orchestrated matters to the degree Nightchill had implied., that opportunism and serendipity was as much responsible . . . Otherwise, against the Elder Gods, none of us stand a chance, including the Crippled God. He thinks of the long chain of many links that would have had to lead to what happened and decides “unless we are all playing out roles that are predetermined and so inevitable—thereby potentially knowable by such things as the Elder Gods—unless that, then, what each adn every one of us chooses to do, or not to do, can have profound consequences. Not just on our own lives, but on the world—the worlds, every realm in existence.” And he recalls how Duiker had made the same argument. He doesn’t see how his normal uncertainty, scepticism, purposelessness, and other flaws will make him a good Master: “gods, talk about the wrong choice . . . </span><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">“</span><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307"> Paran comes across Cafal, who refers to him as “The One Who Blesses.” This makes Paran reevaluate his role: “Adjudicator, I’d thought. Obviously more complicated that that . . . I think I dislike this notion of blessing. But . . . how else does a Master of the Deck conclude arbitration?” Paran says he was sensing there is a secret in the canoes and Cafal, taking him to one of the boats, shows him a hidden compartment with a remarkably preserved sword inside. Paran suggests it must be sorcery but Cafal says no, they just used to be master craftsfolk and employed “metals that have yet to be rediscovered,” but “we have lost the ancient knowledge.” Cafal tells Paran they swords will be given to children so they can grow up attuned to them. Paran guesses another secret—that the Barghast will learn the canoe-making art again and no longer consider the land their home. Cafal says he is correct, and adds that Taur wants Paran to bless the Barghast gods. Paran says the gods don’t need it, and when Cafal says nevertheless, Paran admits he doesn’t know how. He suggests Cafal gather the shamans and talk about it. He adds that he’ll have to think about the blessing because he is “a cautious bastard.” Cafal tells Paran one with power must act decisively and Paran says he will, but not precipitiously. As Paran leaves, Cafal warns him the Mask Council doesn’t like the idea of him (they have yet to sanction Keruli being added to the Council). He says Keruli will probably also ask Paran’s blessing on K’rul’s behalf.</span></p><p>SCENE 13</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">Bauchelain asks Quick Ben why he entered their estate. Quick begins with a discussion of demonic summoning, calling it the “rarest and most difficult discipline among the necromantic arts . . . [its] power from Hood’s own warren is deeply tainted with Chaos.” He stops to ask Bauchelain why he thinks summoning is “death-aspected” and Bauchelain replies it is because summoning is “the assertion of absolute control over a life-force . . . The threat of annihilation is inherently death-aspected.” Quick continues, mentioning that the warrens are poisoned and Bauchelain says there are “many flavours to chaotic power. That which assails the warrens has little to do with the elements . . . with which I am involved,” though he admits the “infection is an irritant . . . that threatens to get worse [and] perhaps . . . I shall need to retaliate upon whomever is responsible.” He adds that Broach, because he works more with Hood’s warren, is more affected and thus more annoyed/concerned. Quick offers to reveal the party responsible and when Bauchelain assumes Quick is looking for allies against that entity, Quick Ben says no and in fact he’ll reject offers of such from Bauchelain. Bauchelain asks if Quick Ben puts himself on a level with gods, then, and Quick says “I don’t rival gods . . . but sometimes I beat them at their own game.” Bauchelain says he is growing to like Quick’s company, and that he has been a “worthy diversion,” but unfortunately Broach wants to kill Quick Ben. Quick warns Broach should stay on the mantle and when Broach begins sembling out of rook form, Quick uses sorcery to throw him through a wall. Bauchelain asks if he’d like more wine and Quick says yes, and then apologizes for the mess he caused. Bauchelain tells Quick he was impressed, that Bauchelain had never seen six or seven warrens used at once. He asks if Broach will live and Quick answers it would have been rude to kill him. Bauchelain says his curiosity has been piqued, which is too bad for Quick as that often “result [s] in regrettable violence to the one being questioned.” He tells Quick Ben has has concluded that Quick is “used up” thanks to his unleashing all those warrens and says things will go better if Quick Ben just tells him everything he wants to know. Quick says that isn’t possible, though he will reveal the one behind the poison is the Crippled God. Bauchelain tells Quick Ben it’s too bad he didn’t hold back some of his power and Quick answers “But Bauchelain, I did” and strikes Bauchelain with his power.</span></p><p>SCENE 14</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">Quick Ben meets Reese in the front hallway and tells him the necromancers need him.

Quick draws on Talamandas’ power, saying he needs to find the sticksnare’s threshold, what he can take in case of emergency. As he touches Talamandas’ power, he finds what he suspected: “Hood’s. Through and through. Of the Barghast gods barely a drop . . . wonders what’s drawing on their energies? There’s a card in the deck, in the House of Death, that’s been a role unfulfilled for a long, long time. The Magi. I think it’s just found a fact—one painted on a stupid acorn. Talamandas, you may have made a terrible mistake. And as for you, Barghast gods . . . never hand your servants over to another god, because . . . that god’s likely to turn them into weapons aimed directly at your back . . . Lucky for you I’m here.” Quick Ben draws hard on the power and “pulls”, calling on Hood and then “within his clenched hand was the rough weave of cloth . . . The breath of Death flowed over the wizard . . heavy with rage. And, in the clutch of a mortal, entirely helpless.” He demands Hood tells him what he’s up to, threatening to drag Hood all the way through so “Fener won’t be the only god who’s fair game.” Hood tells Quick Paran must not sanction the House of Chains, and says the CG is finding “adherents among the pantheon . . . Poliel, mistress of Pestilence aspires to the role of Consort to the King in Chains. A Herald has been recruited. An ancient warrior seeks to become Reaver, whilst the House has found, in a distant land, its Mortal Sword. Mowri now embraces the Three—Cripple, Leper, and Fool—which are in place of Spinner, Mason and Soldier. Most disturbing of all, ancient power trembles around the last of the dread cards.” Quick tells Hood Paran isn’t dumb and blind, and in fact probably sees more clearly and objectively than Hood. In any case, his concern is the poisoned warrens. Hood warns Quick he’s being led astray, that “the Seer is at the heart of an altogether different tale.” Quick says he’d already guessed that and still plans on taking down the Seer, which Hood says will gain Quick nothing. Quick says he’ll call on Hood again, warning him that the young gods Hood seeks to take advantage of won’t stay young and weak for long (the Barghast gods, Treach) and that since the young gods have held up their end of the bargain, Hood must as well, including releasing Talamandas. And he mentions how Hood screwed up once already with Dassem Ultor. Hood grudgingly accepts what Quick says, though mentioning “You will be mine one day, mortal,” to which Quick replies “let’s just luxuriate in the anticipation, shall we?” before releasing Hood back to his realm. Talamandas comes back, unaware of all that just happened. They continue to the Thrall.</span></p><p>SCENE 17</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">Paran imagines his home in Unta, with his parents dead, Felisin in the prison mines, and Tavore as adjunct. He wonders if she ever rides by or think of it, though he knows she was “cold-eyed, hers a brutal rationality, pragmatism with a thousand honed edges.” And he thinks how Felisin will be unshielded “from the worst of human nature . . . taken under wing . . . by some pimp or pit-thug. A flower crushed underfoot.” He assumes Tavore has a plan to rescue Felisin, but it will be too late—Felisin will be child no more—and thinks it would have been more merciful to have simply killed her, “and now I fear you will some day pay dearly.” He thinks “Hood feels close tonight.” Gruntle appears and the two seems to have a natural bond. When Paran says he thinks Trake “chose wisely,” Gruntle replies “not if he expects piety, or demands vows . . . I don’t even like fighting.” But Paran says that makes him a wiser choice: “reluctance to unsheathe those swords and all that represent seems a good thing to me.” Gruntle says if it weren’t for what happened to Stonny and Harlo, he’d have hid in the tunnels, then asks why the Malazans are here fighting. Paran wryly answers “we ran out of enemies” and when Gruntle asks if fighting is that important to him, Paran replies “no, it isn’t. But for men like Dujek Onearm and Whiskeyjack, it’s the sum total of their lives. They’re makers of history . . . the soldiers . . . are the physical will of the commanders they serve, and so are their own makers of history, one soldier at a time.” Gruntle asks what happens when the commanders are idiots, and Parans says generally the Empire has good ones, though “my own noble class has made destructive inroads on that tradition . . . The Empress has finally recognized the rot, however, and has already acted upon it, though likely too late.” Gruntle points out she just outlawed one of her best, and when Paran says it was “politics,” Gruntle says it “has the sound of a feint to me.” Paran says he can’t say. When Gruntle says Paran may be too open for his own good, Paran opens up even more and tells him of the impending choice re the House of Chains, adding he’s leaning toward listening to the single voice inside him—his own—saying he should sanction it, despite all the voices saying it’s a really bad idea. Gruntle tells Paran he felt his god recoil at that, but he could care less and when Paran asks why it doesn’t scare him, Gruntle says “Right now, the Crippled God’s outside the whole damned game, meaning he’s not bound by any rules . .. he just keeps kicking [the board] whenever he gets the chance.” Paran says Gruntle is right, if he sanctions the House of Chains, the CG becomes “bound.” </span></p><p>SCENE 18</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">Quick Ben appears on the Thrall plaza and heads for Paran and Gruntle, while Talamandas makes himself unseen. After Paran introduces the two, Gruntle says Quick Ben smells of death and he doesn’t like it, but since a Bridgeburner saved Stonny, he’ll wait to see if the smell wears off. Quick Ben tells them Brood is calling a meeting of all the commanders, including Paran, Gruntle, Taur, and whoever leads the Grey Swords. When Quick Ben brings it up, Paran tells Quick he has yet to decide on the House of Chains and Quick shouldn’t try to pressure him. Quick Ben says he has no intention to; in fact, Hood just tried it with him and it “riled” him. When he says it just made Quick want to do the opposite, Gruntle laughs and says he likes this night’s company. Quick goes on to tell Paran that his sickness isn’t from resisting the power but from resisting himself, and he should listen to his instincts. Paran asks if that advice comes from Quick Ben or Whiskeyjack, and Quick says it’d be the same were Whiskeyjack there. Paran admits he and Gruntle had pretty much come to the same conclusion, and he thinks the gods might get angry. Gruntle says “let ’em,” and Quick Ben thinks “one more thing, Hood. You and your fellow gods have been calling out the rules uncontested for far too long. Step back now and see how us mortals fare. I think you’re in for a surprise or two.”</span></p><p>SCENE 19</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">The Capustan survivors exit the tunnels as the Grey Swords stand guard, giving them mental reassurance as well as physical protection. Itkovian thinks the contract with the city is almost ended adn wonders what the Grey Swords will do, having been cut down from seven thousand to three hundred and having lost Fener, which makes them merely a mercenary company seeking gold. He thinks “what I need is fanatics . . . not Trake’s . . . There were two other war-aspected gods . . . northern gods . . . in [Hetan’s’ eyes I was a wolf. Very well then . . . </span><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">“</span><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307"> Having made his decision, he sends the recruit for the captain, saying “We three have a task before us.” As she rides off, he wonders at the feeling of emptiness he has, “as if he personally was to have no part to play in what was to come beyond this act of preparation—no subsequent role in what had to be done . . . a new Reve.”</span></p><p>SCENE 20</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.571871581650307">Itkovian, the recruit, and Captain Norval ride to the Barghast camp, where a group of old women await him. They sense his “soul is nothing but ashes”, but one says “he would promise a firestorm to a frozen forest. Togetha and Farand, the lovers lost to each other for eternity, the winter hearts that howl . . They come closer—only not from the north, oh no, not the north.” Itkovian points to the recruit and calls her the Mortal Sword, but the old woman says no, another has been found and besides, the recruit has “too much caring” in her hands; she will be Destriant. And Norul Shield Anvil. When Norul is confused, Itkovian explains: “It must be done . . . Togg, Lord of Winter, a god of war long forgotten, recalled among the Barghast as the wolf-spirit, Togetha. And his lost mate, the she-wolf, Fanderay, Farand in the Barghast tongue . . . A Reve must be proclaimed, kneeling before the wolf god and the wolf goddess . . . The Grey Swords are remade.” He tells the two he cannot be part as he is Shield Anvil to Fener and Fener is gone. He advises them to seek “fanatics . . . people with nothing left to their lives . . . People who have been made lost . . . you will find the people you seek, sir, among the Tenescowri.” And as he sees her face, he feels guilt that he gave her no choice.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER NINETEEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Silverfox and Kruppe, followed by her two marines, head to the Gathering. They are joined by thousands of Ay, then tens of thousands of T’lan Imass. Kruppe senses “Despair. Or perhaps after this seeming eternity, only its ashes.” He wonders if they have memories or feelings: “True Memories? Of enlivened flesh and the wind’s caress, of the laughter of children? Memories of love? When frozen between life and death, in the glacial in-between, what can exist of mortal feelings? . . . Only memories of ice, of ice and no more than that. Gods below . . . such sorrow.” He recognizes Pran Chole (from the birth of Silverfox) and is shocked at the change: “my heart breaks . . . at what you have become.” Pran Chole greets Silverfox and tells her he was with K’rul at her birth and Silverfox’s answer is bitter: “Are you my father then? If so, this reunion has come far too late. For us both.” Kruppe worries over this turn into anger, and watches Pran Chole’s face “wither” at her response. When he tells her he could not follow her after she was born, she answers angrily: “After all, you had a vow awaiting you . . . the one that turned your hearts to ash. All for a war. But that is what war is all about, isn’t it? Leaving home. your loved ones—the very capacity of love itself . . . You abandoned everything.” And when she cuts herself off, Kruppe thinks she meant to add they abandoned her as well. Another bonecaster, Okral Lom steps forward and says since they had nothing to do with her birth, they have nothing to do with her anger. He corrects her, though, and tells her Pran Chole, while accepting the burden of her anger, cannot be considered her father—”the one you seek is not among us . . . Your souls were forged in the Warren of Tellan, yet not in the distant past—the past in which Pran Chole lived . . . the unveiled warren of which I speak belonged to the First Sword Onos T’oolan. Now clanless, he walks alone, and that solitude has twisted his power . . . by what he seeks.” When Silverfox asks what Tool wants, Okral answers she’ll hear from him since he’s coming, but he’ll be “rather late.” Kruppe realizes Pran Chole took on Silverfox’s anger silently as a gift, to give her “a focus for her anger” and he recalls the compassion he saw in Pran Chole’s eyes, and wonder if all Imass were once like him. Another Bonecaster, Ay Estros of Logros T’lan Imass steps up and says Logros could only send two because the Logros T’lan Imass are hunting renegades—”our own kin who have broken from the vow.” He then introduces Olar Ethil: “first among the Bonecasters, the First Soletaken,” and says she was set a different task by Logros and so they haven’t seen her in many years. Olar Ethil says Silverfox “commanded” her dreams as she neared the Gathering and Silverfox say she did, though she didn’t know whose they were and they can talk about it later. Olar Ethil says the task Logros gave her was to find the remaining T’lan Imass armies from the First Gathering: The four clans left of the Bentract are trapped in the Warren of Chaos on Jacuruku she thinks (she couldn’t find them); The Orshan, Ifayle, and Kerluhm appear completely lost and she assumes they no longer exist. She tells Silverfox Logros was commanded to seek the other armies by Kellanved after the Emperor took the First Throne. When Silverfox points out Kellanved no longer occupies, Olar Ethil agrees but says he has not yielded it because rather than die he ascended and took the Throne of Shadow, which meant the T’lan Imass stopped serving the Empire. Ethil calls that period an “uncertain” time when the clans were divided (and then distracted by discovering some surviving Jaghut in the Jhag Odhan), but that some clans have returned to the Empire’s service. Silverfox asks if that was the question that led to the renegades and Olar Ethil says no, they “found another path . . . they have, on occasion, employed the Warren of Chaos.” This last bit makes Kruppe suspicious over just whom the renegades serve. Silverfox asks Olar Ethil what shape she takes and the response is “an undead twin to Tiam, who spawned all dragons.” Silverfox asks Pran Chole to forgive her earlier harshness and says Okral Lom was correct in chastising her. When she begins to say how long she’s waited, Kruppe starts to point out just how old the T’lan Imass before her are and she says “thanks, I’ll handle my self-accusation myself.” She then asks if any Jaghut are left and Pran Chole says they only know of one pure blood in this realm—the Seer—and says in answer to the next question that he does not know how he is commanding K’Chain. When Silverfox starts to question what will happen after the Seer is slain, Kruppe steps forward and says that the fact that you only “know of one” doesn’t mean there is only one. Olar Ethil says other ones “remain. Isolated. Hidden . . . We believe they exist, but we cannot find them.” Kruppe says they’re looking for an end to the war anyway and when Kruppe asks how he knew that, he says “Sorrow unsurpassed and unsurpassing. They in truth seek to become dust . . . The T’lan Imass wish oblivion.” Pran Chole says her words can shatter the Ritual’s bindings.” Which Silverfox says she’d grant “if all the Jaghut on this world had ceased to exist . . . For that is the burden laid upon me. My intended purpose” but widens it to “the threat of tyranny removed, finally, once and for all time.” But Kruppe tells her the T’lan Imass have won the war, and if there is a new tyrant among the remaining Jaghut, they have many more who would oppose them now: Gods, Ascendants, humans—”The time has passed . . . For the Jaghut, and thus for the T’lann Imass . . . these indomitable warriors are weary, weary beyond all comprehension. They have existed for hundreds of thousands of years for one sole cause. And that cause is now a farce. Pointless. Irrelevant . . . Redeem them. Please.” Pran Chole agrees, saying they will end the Seer then request an end for themselves . . “We have no reason to exist, thus we exist without honor, and it is destroying us.” When he tells Pran Chole the remainder of her life shall be hers, she asks “What life? I am neither Rhivi nor Malazan. I am not even truly human . . . I am your kin, damn you! Your first child in three hundred thousand years! Am I to be abandoned again?” All the Imass but Olar Ethil drop to their knees, and after saying to Silverfox, “We beg you to release us,” Olar Ethil drops as well. Silverfox says “no” and the Ay howl.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Whiskeyjack and Korlat, clearly made up, overlook the Tenescowri army, with Anaster in front along with a dozen women, seemingly mad. Korlat says she senses sorcery among the women, but that they are made uneasy by Rake’s near presence. Suddenly, their power strikes out at the waiting Malazan army and the Tenescowri charge, but the army stands pat and then Rake arrives in “his fullest power” in Soletaken dragon form. The front lines of the Tenescowri, save Anaster, collapse and fall back. Rake swoops and grabs Anaster, then flings him aside as Anaster feels like “poison” to him. He swoops back and breathes Kurald Galain at the Tenescowri, dissolving (literally) a huge swath of the army, cutting it in two. When he wheels for another pass, the army scatters and runs. Rake lands and sembles before a group of the Women of the Dead Seed and before Whiskeyjack’s horrified eyes begins killing them with Dragnipur. Whiskeyjack rides out and between Rake and his next victim. When he tells Rake to stop, Rake says what he is doing “is a mercy,” but Whiskeyjack replies it is a “judgement . . . and a sentence,” referring to the sword. Rake accepts it but tells Whiskeyjack he must kill them then for they are regaining their powers. He refuses at first—”I am no executioner,” but Rake makes clear he’ll do it otherwise, so Whiskeyjack begins to kill them. When he is done, he looks up to see the army watching and thinks: “To have witnessed this. Now, I am indeed damned. From this, no return. No matter what the words of explanation, of justification. No matter the crimes committed by my victims. I have slain. Not soldiers, not armed opponents, but creatures assailed by madness, stunned senseless, uncomprehending.” And when he turns to see Rake, he begins to see: “This burden—you have taken it before, assumed it long ago . . . this burden that now assails my soul, it is what you live with, have lived with for centuries. The price for the sword on your back.” Rake says Whiskeyjack should have let him continue doing it, and that he would have, but did not want to fight Whiskeyjack, and so he caused Whiskeyjack pain by trying to spare him. Whiskeyjack realizes and apologizes to Rake for giving him no choice. Rake says Anaster has been captured and Whiskeyjack thinks they now have the luxury of time to use military justice: “that rigid structure that so easily absolves personal responsibility.” As they head off, Whiskeyjack sorrows over his biggest regret: “you asked me to step aside and you called it a mercy. I misunderstood you. A mercy not to the Women of the Dead Seed. But to me . . . I saw only your brutality—and that hurt you. Better for us both, had you crossed blades with me . . . I am not worth such friends. Old man . . make this your last war.”</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>When they find Anaster, held by Korlat and other Andii, he sees tears in her eyes. He notes riders from Dujek and Brood and is shamed again. Looking at Anaster, he sees he has lost an eye, and that he also looks “horrifyingly lifeless . . . fundamentally indifferent.” Anaster addresses him as his mother’s killer and when Whiskeyjack says he is sorry for that, Anaster replies “I am not. She was insane. A prisoner of herself, possessed by her own demons,” something Anaster says is “a plague, is it not? Ever spreading. Devouring lives. That is why you will, ultimately fail. All of you. You become what you destroy.” Rake answers that “no more appropriate words could come from a cannibal” and asks Anaster what he thinks they should do with him. Anaster momentarily seems to lose his strength/confidence and whispers “kill me.” Korlat says “he lost control. His fear has a face. One I have not seen before” and then tells Anaster “there is darkness within you . . . virulent cousin to Kurald Galain. A darkness of the soul.” Rake adds “a soldier’s face . . . From Capustan . . . one who promises something other than death, something far more terrible.” Anaster says it’s Itkovian and that he would rather they kill him now than let Itkovian take his soul. But Rake says he sees “no absolution in your particular madness . . . no cause for mercy” and says for now they’ll have him meet Itkovian and then decide. Dujek and Whiskeyjack agree. Anaster unsuccessfully tries to grab a dagger then collapses. Whiskeyjack edges closer to Dujek, who tells him “I comprehend your mercy. Rake’s sword—but could you not have waited.” Whiskeyjack says no and when Dujek says “executions demand procedures,” Whiskeyjack says then demote me. Dujek tells him that isn’t what he meant, “I know well enough the significance of such procedures—the real reason for their existing . . . A sharing of necessary but brutal acts.” Whiskeyjack finishes the idea—”diminishes the personal cost, aye”—and then says Rake could have handled it easily probably, Whiskeyjack “diminished his personal cost” and it’s done. Dujek says it doesn’t have to be but before he can continue Whiskeyjack cuts him off and says “no.” Korlat interrupts then and says Anaster “could not bear leading his army, could not bear to see the starvation, the loss and desperation, and so was resolved to send it to its death, to absolute annihilation. As an act of mercy . . . For himself he committed crimes that could only be answered with death. Execution at the hands of those survivors among his victims. But not a simple death . . . He seeks damnation as his sentence. An eternity of damnation.” When she says she can’t comprehend such “self-loathing,” Whiskeyjack thinks he can “for I feel as if I am tottering on the very edge of that steep slope myself.” Dujek moves off and Korlat tries to comfort Whiskeyjack by telling him the women were powerful with Chaos, that Rake’s attack—meant to kill—had only stunned them and that just momentarily, and that they would have wreaked havoc. Whiskeyjack says he gets it was necessary: “War has its necessities, Korlat, and I have always understood that. Always known the cost. But this day . . . I have realized something else. War is not a natural state. It is an imposition . . . With its rules, we willingly yield our humanity. Speak not of just causes, worthy goals. We are takers of life. Servants of Hood one and all.” When Korlat tries to point out the women would have killed hundreds or thousands, he continues: “I have commanded the same in my time. What difference is there between us?” Her reply is that he questions what he does. Whiskeyjack says it doesn’t matter, that his army has seen him commit murder, but he is immediately cut off by her intense response: “Do not dare underestimate them! I have come to know many of your soldiers. They are not fools . . . they understand . . . Do you not think that they—each in his or her own way—have faced the choice you faced this morning? The knifepoint turn of their lives? And every one of them still feels the scar within them . . . They witnessed. The saw, in fullest knowing . . . I felt the same. They hurt for you. With every brutal blow, they felt the old wounds within them resonate in sympathy. Commander, your shame is an insult. Discard it, or you will deliver unto your soldiers the deepest wound of all.” Whiskeyjack sees she is right (acknowledging it with her own words about human’s “lack of complexity”), but says he still fears to face them. She tells him they will “follow you into the Abyss, should you command,” which he calls “the most frightening though uttered thus far today.” When he mentions Dujek’s displeasure, she says he just want to keep the army alive. When Whiskeyjack objects, saying he has no interest in stealing Dujek’s authority, she tells him too late—you just did. That was, she adds, why Laseen demoted him and promoted Dujek—to upset the “natural order” Whiskeyjack just recreated. At first Whiskeyjack doesn’t buy it, but then realizes she is right, and that at Darujhistan Laseen didn’t want the Bridgeburners dead; she wanted him destroyed. Korlat warns him to be on guard; “your belief in honour is being used against you.”</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Coll joins Murillio at the Mhybe’s wagon, tells him Silverfox and Kruppe haven’t been seen since yesterday and fills him in on the just completed events. They both think the Mhybe has been forgotten. Murillio says they are there simply to “oversee the descent,” “prisoners of this unwelcome circumstance as much as she is.” They decide to help her escape, to take her with them and find someone who might be able to help her in Capustan, even though it “will likely mean our financial ruin and all that might be achieved is a kinder end to her life.”</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>The Mhybe dreams of pursuit again, howls, “the voices of winter, and as she runs she finds a cavern, “a shaping of a soul, a soul lost within itself.” She enters, knowing “it was her mind that moved, her mind alone, leaving her body, questing out, seeking that chained beast. A man’s voice (Toc’s) asking “who?” startles her. She answers “a mother,” and he laughs: “Another game then? You’ve no words Mother. You’ve never had them . . . Leave me. I am beyond taunting. I circle my own chain, here in my mind. This place is not for you. Perhaps, in finding it, you think you’ve defeated my last line of defense . . . But you’ve no power here . . . I imagine seeing my own face as in a mirror. But it’s the wrong eye . . . staring back at me. And worse, it’s not even human . . . You and your kind played with winter. Omtose Phellack. But you never understood it. True winter . . . The face I see before me, Seer, is winter’s face. A wolf’s. A god’s.” The Mhybe tells hm her daughter knows wolves and Toc says “he does indeed.” When she corrects him on the gender, he calls her Seer again and she says “I am not who you think I am. I am an old woman. Of the Rhivi. And my daughter wishes to see me dead . . . She’s sent wolves after me. To rend my soul . . . I’ve come here to escape.” Toc refuses to believer her: I defy you . . . There is a god here, Seer, . . . Not even your dear mother, who holds me so tight, dares challenge him . . . he was lost. Lost. . . . I am helping him to find himself. He’s growing aware.” The Mhybe says she doesn’t understand, she came here to die, she is fleeing her daughter, and Toc answers: “Flight is an illusion. Even Mother comprehends that. I am not her child, yet she cannot help herself. She even possesses memories of a time when she was a true Matron . . . children who loved her, and other children—who betrayed her. And left her to suffer for eternity.” He describes how when she was free, and found the world so changed, her children dead and entombed, she went to the Seer, “her adopted son,” (“you”) and showed the Seer his power so she could use it to raise her children and rebuild their city, but it was a delusion that drove her crazy. And her insanity allowed the Seer to usurp her, imprison her. The Mhybe says her daughter did the same—asking if this is the curse of motherhood, to which Toc replies it is the curse of love. A howl arises, and Toc, though now in a deeper, different voice, says it is “My mate. She’s coming.” He howls in response and the Mhybe is thrown out of the cavern where the wolves find her. She awakens and Coll and Murillio see she shows the scratches of her dream and wonder if her nightmares are true. They recommit to getting her out of there when they get to Capustan.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER TWENTY</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.46446198587950516">Coral City is described, an extremely narrow harbor like a fjord that nearly bisects the city. Instead of docks, the cliffs are cut into long piers, with netting hanging down to serve as a place for the ships’ anchors. The netting workers were known as cat-men. The Seer had told Toc that Coral, though many times assaulted, had never fallen, and so he is happy to retreat to it via a scorched earth policy, content to give up Setta, Maurik, and Lest to the invading alliance, while the invasion from the south will be halted by a rough sea he has filled with ice. To defend Coral, he tells Toc he has cadres of mages, a thousand K’Chain Kell Hunters, and elite soldiers. As Toc enters the city with a Seerdomin (warrior priest), the Seerdomin points out the corpses in the netting and tells him all the cat-men and families had all starved to death. Toc cannot stand without assistance, his muscles atrophied and bones twisted and broken. The Seerdomin has given him his cloak, a sign of compassion that surprises Toc. As he looks at the ocean, Toc thinks no matter the Seer’s words, Baaljaag would not be bent from the path the wolf goddess has set to rejoin her mate that lies within Toc. Nor would, he thinks, Tool or the Seguleh give up, though he guesses Envy and the wounded Garath will “tire of the hunt,” especially as Envy was less driven than carried by whim. He thinks he should apologize to Envy for his mocking, leaving “detachment . . . to the gods.” The Seerdomin interrupts his thoughts with memories of his childhood in Coral. He recalls good memories at first, then tells how his father returned home one night to find “his family had embraced the Faith. His wife to the Tenescowri. His sons to the ranks, eldest begun schooling as a Seerdomin . . . seeing my uniform. Seeing my mother—hearing her mindless shrieks. Seeing my brothers with spears . . . my sisters naked and clinging to men thrice their age . . . he tacked into the offshore breeze. I watched his sail until I could see it no more. It was my way . . . of saying good luck. Of saying well done.” Toc wonders how the Seer could have done these things to his own people. When the bell signals his time to return to the Matron, he thanks the Seerdomin for the cloak. When the Seerdomin offers his help, saying, “Your weight is as nothing,” Toc responds, “easily borne, you mean,” and the Seerdomin replies, “I did not say that.”</span></p><p>SCENE 2</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.46446198587950516">Itkovian and Captain Norul watch as Hedge and the sappers take down an unsafe building, before continuing on their way to the meeting of commanders. The new Destriant is in charge of an internment camp set up for the Tenescowri, who will soon be recruited for the Grey Swords. At the gate, they come across Gruntle and Stonny, who tell him the Mask Council has already gone in for a “private chat.” Gruntle tells her not to worry as Keruli is with them, but she’s furious they take any leadership after they hid while the Grey Swords fought and died. Itkovian tells her they are the only leadership left. They spot Humbrall Taur coming and decide to try and catch up with the Council once the Barghast arrive.</span></p><p>SCENE 3</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.46446198587950516">Taur, Hetan, and Cafal are angry as well at the Mask Council’s “attempted usurpation.” As they near the carriage with Rath’Hood, Rath’Burn, Rath’Shadowthrone, and Keruli in it, Itkovian grieves for his friends now dead. They catch up to the carriage, and Stonny and Rath’Shadowthrone exchange insults.</span></p><p>SCENE 4</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.46446198587950516">Picker and Blend watch Paran and Quick Ben preparing to head over to the meeting. Blend tells Picker what she’s heard: the Tenescowri being fed, the Grey Swords losing Fener and switching gods to Togg and Fanderay and now recruiting among the Tenescowri. Paran and Quick Ben come over looking for Spindle and Picker tells Paran he went off with Antsy and Detoran and maybe a few others to speak to a ruler of a southern city who wanted to meet with a representative of Dujek’s army. Paran is horrified at the idea of Antsy as spokesperson, and tells her to go collect them and send the ruler to the Thrall. Bauchelain and Broach show up and demand supplies—food, water, clothing—and “respect,” and Picker knocks him unconscious with a punch while Blend coldcocks Broach from behind. Reese arrives and Picker tells him to inform the necromancers of the “proper forms of address when they awaken.” She and Blend leave.</span></p><p>SCENE 5</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.46446198587950516">As they ride past the internment camp, Paran says there’s going to be trouble with the Capans wanting to kill them all, with the Mask Council’s blessing (as he tells Quick this, he thinks he sees something come and go on Quick Ben’s shoulder—Talamandas). Quick says the Grey Swords will defend the Tenescowri and when Paran says the residents might attack despite them, Quick Ben says they’ll think twice before attacking the Grey Swords who defended them and who survived the siege. They spot some riders from the north, led by Silverfox. Paran tells Quick Ben the Second Gathering has happened, thinking to himself: “she’s stopped reaching out to me. Tattersail. Nightchill. Bellurdan—something’s happened. Something unexpected.” When Quick Ben asks if Tattersail is still dominant, Paran says he doesn’t know, but that Silverfox is not a “Bonecaster in truth” and the Malazans should no longer assume they can predict her actions. They let the riders catch up (Silverfox, Kruppe, the two marines). Paran can tell Silverfox is upset, angry, hurt and senses “she’s thrown up a wall between us . . . she’s become guarded, a possessor of secrets.” When Quick Ben starts to ask Silverfox cuts him off and says she isn’t going to tell him anything, saying, “The anger you would face is Nightchill’s, and the rest of us will do nothing to restrain it.” Paran realizes “if anything truly existed between us, it is now over. She has left Tattersail behind . . . Perhaps we have both moved on. The pressure of what we have grown into, our hearts cannot overcome.”</span></p><p>SCENE 6</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.46446198587950516">The parties reach the bottom of the hill where the parley is to meet and Itkovian sends Norul ahead to speak for the Grey Swords, as he is no longer part. Realizing his uniform is still that of an officer by the reaction of the Malazan soldiers around, he drops his symbols of rank to the ground and then exchanges his rich helmet for a plain Malazan one with one of the soldiers. Itkovian asks if the soldier thinks the parley group would mind if he went near to watch and the soldier says, “they’d be honored.” Itkovian says he doubts it and then asks how he can go without being noticed. As he passes, the Malazans salute him. He is impressed by the camp he walks through. When he arrives, he sees that the parley hasn’t begun and he wonders if there has already been an argument. Brood notices him there and says they’ve been waiting for him, calling him Defender of Capustan. Itkovian objects, saying to his “shame” that title does not belong to him as he “failed” by not holding the city long enough to be relieved. Brood tells him he only failed because the task was impossible, but Itkovian says he doesn’t wish to debate semantics, and that as he leads nobody, and any “responsibilities that I must one day embrace are mine to bear, and thus must be borne alone,” he wishes to simply observe. Brood says Itkovian is welcome here and the parley begins. Keruli asks where the Andii and Rake are, as well as Moon’s Spawn. Brood says they will not discuss tactics, that Capustan was only a temporary stop on the way to finish this war, and that while Moon’s Spawn and the Andii will play a part, the alliance will not say more about it. Keruli says that while Brood is right that the Masked council’s primary concern is the city, that because it is made up of servants of gods, they know of the concern in the pantheon: the Grey Swords going from lost Fener to the Wolf gods, Gruntle become Mortal Sword of Trake, the Barghast gods reawakening, and Brood with Burn’s hammer. Kallor interrupts to ask harshly why Keruli is the only one on the Council not wearing a mask and thus not revealing his god. When Keruli asks if Kallor still “cart [s] that meaningless throne” around, Kallor recognizes him as K’rul: “I thought it was you” and mocks his disguise. When Keruli/K’rul says, “issues of physical manifestation have proved problematic,” Kallor gloats K’rul has lost his power, but K’rul clarifies that “it has evolved, and so I am forced to adjust, and learn.” Kallor says that means he can kill K’rul, but Keruli/K’rul replies “in your dreams. But then you no longer dream, do you, Kallor? The Abyss takes you into its embrace each night. Oblivion, your own personal nightmare.” Brood warns Kallor his patience with him is wearing thin and when Kallor reveals Keruli is K’rul, Brood answers, “I had gathered as much.” Again, Keruli corrects him, saying he is “a limited manifestation.” Gruntle, angry, brings up Harllo’s death and Keruli says he regrets he couldn’t save him. Rath’Shadowthrone then interrupts, arguing Keruli can’t sit on the Council, which makes Whiskeyjack laugh out loud. Brood tells Keruli/K’rul that he assumes he and the priests will figure out what they can do to deal with whatever threats are affecting the pantheon and the warrens, noting the source of the threats isn’t the Seer himself, but says this meeting is to deal with the march logistics. K’rul says fine, though he expects “a few masks coming off in these proceedings.” The Barghast suggest how to split the forces—one to Setta, one to Lest, then meet at Maurik and march on Coral. The Barghast go with Dujek and the Grey Swords with Brood. They all agree. Rath’Burn then turns to Brood and says, “To you was entrusted the task of awakening [Burn] at the time of her greatest need” and accuses Brood of deceiving Burn by not doing so yet. Brood answers, “I have </span>constrained her.” When Gruntle wonders aloud how the gods never seem to learn with regard to mortals, Rath’Burn calls him a fool and says “If Brood does not act, Burn will die. And when she dies, so too does all life on this world. This is the choice . . . Topple a handful of corrupt civilizations or absolute annihilation.” She then demands that Brood give her the hammer. Brood, surprising her, does, but when she grabs it her wrists and arms break. While Artanthos, at Dujek’s order, gets a healer, Brood tells the priestess: “The difference between you and your goddess, woman, is faith. You see only two options . . .so did the Sleeping Goddess, at first. She gave to me the weapon . . . and the freedom to choose. It has taken a long while for me to understand what else she gave to me. I have withheld acting . . . and thought myself a coward . . . yet a small wisdom has finally lodged itself in my head.” K’rul finishes the thought: “Burn’s faith . . . that you would find a third choice.” Mallet arrives but Brood heals her himself, and the purity of his Denul warren shocks those who can see it. K’rul stands suddenly and looks at the arrival of Paran’s group, specifically at Quick Ben, who makes eye contact with K’rul and shrugs (Itkovian thinks “strangely uneven [ly]—as if some invisible weight burdened his left shoulder), at which K’rul sighs. Kallor demands to know how Brood’s warren was not poisoned and K’rul says, “It seems the illness has been pushed back from this location. Temporary, yet sufficient. Perhaps this is another lesson in the powers of faith, which I shall endeavour to heed,” and Itkovian thinks K’rul is speaking in two layers, one for the general group and one aimed specifically at Quick Ben. Silverfox mentions to Brood about him sending Korlat after her and he says it was merely to find out where she was, though Korlat appears lost since she hasn’t returned. Silverfox says the Ay are guiding her back. Brood asks if the Second Gathering is done and when Silverfox says yes, he wants to know if the T’lan Imass will be joining them. She answers that the T’lan Imass have “tasks . . . that will require a journey to the Pannion Domin” and says they will deal with any K’Chain. When she refuses to say more about the tasks, Kallor says they want the Seer because he is a Jaghut. Silverfox asks Kallor what they would do if they captured him, calling him insane due to Chaos and the Crippled God’s manipulations. She says execution is the only answer and that killing Jaghut is what the T’lan Imass exist for. Dujek interrupts to say “not always,” saying one of the T’lan Imass freed Raest in Darujhistan. Silverfox admits that is true, and says she doesn’t really understand why, but says in any case Raest was killed. Paran, though, steps in to say Raest is actually alive and K’rul explains he was taken by the Azath house. Silverfox says it doesn’t really matter, and if Tool broke his vow, she’ll deal with him. But Dujek says she’s missing his point: “You make a claim that the T’lan Imass and what they do or don’t do is separate from everyone and everything else. You insist on detachment . . . what you assert is patently untrue.” She says maybe the Logros were “confused” but no longer. Silverfox asks if anyone will deny their claim on the Seer and when Brood and Dujek say no, Itkovian looks at Kruppe, who is smiling, and thinks: “This is a most fell gathering of powers here. Yet why do I believe that the very epicenter of efficacy lies with this strange little man? He holds even K’rul’s regard, as would an admiring companion rest eyes upon a lifelong prodigy of sort . . . whose talents have come to overwhelm his master’s. But there is no envy in that regard, nor even pride—which always whispers of possessiveness . . . the emotion is far more subtle, and complex.” The meeting shifts to discussion of supply and Itkovian turns to leave and is met by Paran, Whiskeyjack, Korlat, and Quick Ben. Looking at Korlat, he is stunned by “such sadness—-an eternity of loss—empty existence . . . Not for my embrace . . . some wounds can never be healed, some memories should never be reawakened. Cast no light upon that darkness. It is too much.” He realizes suddenly he has no god protecting him anymore, that he was now fully “vulnerable to the world’s pain, to its grief.” The Malazans ask him to join them for a drink and he agrees. As they head off, Quick Ben mentions Silverfox and Itkovian says, “She has done a terrible wrong yet upon her shoulders it weighs nothing.” Quick Ben says that is not good and Paran says it’s Nightchill: “And to make matters worse, Nightchill was—is—a whole lot more than what we’d thought. Not just a High Mage . . . She’s all hard edge—her mate Bellurdan was her balance, but of the Thelomen I sense nothing . . . [and Tattersail] is in the shadows. Observing.” When Paran describes it as a “war of wills,” Itkovian corrects him, saying there is no war, that Silverfox is “in agreement. She is calm within,” which Quick Ben says is the most surprising news of the day. Kruppe joins them and says not to worry about Silverfox. He then relates the story of Togg and Fanderay, how they were separated by the Crippled God’s fall, how the Elder Gods tried to help but they were younger then and “did not find ascendancy walking in step with humans or those who would one day become humans.” He says Silverfox is united: “a spirit of hard edges to hold the others to their course . . . another to clasp hard the hurt of abandonment until it can find proper answer. And yet a third spirit, filled with love and compassion . . . and a fourth . . . Pran Chole’s daughter, the one whose true name is indeed the one by which we all know her.” They head off to drink.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.46446198587950516">The two marines, still with Silverfox, are joined by Haradas (the Trygalle mage) and Norul. Haradas asks Silverfox if Telann is unaffected by the poison and if the Guild could use it to supply the armies. Silverfox says it is not poisoned but still potentially dangerous due to renegade T’lan and the Throne of the Beast Hold being contested. She asks if Haradas needs Silverfox to make a portal into it and the sorceress says the Guild has long known how to but hasn’t out of respect and because they had other “less uncivilized” warrens available. Silverfox finds this “remarkable,” especially as none of the Empire’s best mages could do it. Norul tells Silverfox the Grey Swords have sworn to Togg and Fanderay, who will soon be reunited. When she expresses surprise at Silverfox’s lack of knowledge about this, Silverfox begins to say she has nothing to do with “ancient wolf-gods” but then realizes what is coming. Norul asks Silverfox to yield the Ay—”the children of our gods.” Silverfox tells her she needs them “for a gift. A repayment. I have sworn.” Norul objects that the Ay are not “owned” and were caught up in the Ritual originally “in ignorance. Bound by loyalty and love to the flesh and blood Imass. As a result, they lost their souls . . . my gods . . . demand reparation.” Silverfox says no, not until the wolf-gods come physically and manifest their power.” When she asks Norul if the wolf-gods would actually war with the T’lan Imass, Norul says “Togg and Fanderay are ascended </span>beasts. Their souls are unknowable to such as you and me. Who can predict what lies in the hearts of such creatures?” She adds that they will converge with the armies at Coral. Hetan joins them with food and wine, and expresses an interest in bedding Kruppe.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.46446198587950516">Coll and Murillio prepare to spirit the Mhybe out.</span></p><p>SCENE 9</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.46446198587950516">Envy’s group looks out from shore at a rough ocean filled with mountains of ice. Garath is badly wounded and won’t let anyone come near. Baaljaag is also wounded with a spear shaft in the shoulder still, but will not let Envy or the Seguleh tend to the wound. When she wonders how they’ll follow Tool across, Mok says he will face Tool. When Envy asks how the First or Second would react to his putting self-interest over the mission, he says “the demands of the self have primacy always, else there would be no champions . . . no hierarchy at all. The Seguleh would be ruled by mewling martyrs blindly trampling the helpless in their lust for the common good. Or we would be ruled by despots who would hide behind an army to every challenge, creating of brute force a righteous claim to honor.” He says they need to talk and when she brings up the fleeing army, he accuses her of sending plague among them and adds that Garath suffers from it. She tells him that’s nonsense, but he tells her it’s the same symptoms as what the Pannions have. She says fine, “but don’t you see the irony? Poleil, Queen of Diseases, has allied herself with the Crippled God . . . how cunning of me to loot her warren and so beset her allies.” He suggests neither the victims nor Garath appreciate the irony. She heals Garath, who then bares his teeth at her and growls. Mok tells Garath they still need Envy and she says “he can’t understand you. He’s a </span>dog.” Near the shore, they see an iceberg has captured a Meckros city—”cities that ride the oceans.” They decide to use it as a means to cross. They find a T’lan Imass there in very bad shape. She says she has come for the Summons/Gathering: “I am Lanas Tog. Sent to bring word of the fates of the Ifayle T’lan Imass and of my own Kerluhm T’lan Imass . . . I am the last of the Kerluhm. The Ifayle . . . are all but destroyed . . . cannot extricate themselves from the conflict [on] the continent of Assail. Our losses: 29000 Kerluhm. 22,200 Ifayle . . . We have lost this war.” When Envy says “it seems you’ve finally found a Jaghut Tyrant who is more than your match,” Lanas says, “Not Jaghut. Human.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty One</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>The Bridgeburners exit Capustan—”first in, last out.” Silverfox tells Paran her mother has gone missing, as have Coll and Murillio. When Paran asks why she doesn’t use her Ay or T’lan Imass to look, she says she has sent them across the river but refuses to say why. When she accuses Coll and Murillio of “kidnapping” her mother, Paran says kidnapping implies taking away from someone, and since Silverfox abandoned the Mhybe, it can’t be kidnapping. Their conversation gets testier and Paran tells her to give up the guilt, learn to forgive, adding: “I love you still, but with your death . . . I convinced myself that what you and I had . . . was of far vaster and deeper import than it truly was. Of all the weapons we turn upon ourselves, guilt is the sharpest, Silverfox. It can carve one’s own past into unrecognizable shapes, false memories leading to beliefs that sow all kinds of obsessions.” Silverfox says Paran has changed so much she no longer recognizes him, while he replies “I find you all too recognizable.” Returning to the conversation’s topic, he tells her not to worry, that Coll and Murillio probably took it upon themselves, since she wouldn’t, to try and help the Mhybe. She says by taking her they have “sealed her doom . . . my mother is trapped in a nightmare—within her own mind, lost, terrified. Hunted!” When Paran wonders if the true mercy would be to let the Mhybe’s life end, Silverfox refuses: “She is my mother . . . I will not abandon her!” As she leaves, Paran wishes she would simply tell them what her plans are so they don’t continually think she is betraying the Mhybe. He believes Tattersail has lost to Nightchill, and that Silverfox has “become colder than the T’lan Imass you now command.”</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Itkovian watches the barges transporting soldiers. He comes across an artist painting and speaking to a large green toad. The artist introduces himself as Ormulogun of Li Hen, Imperial historical artist: “The old Emperor . . . Artists with every army! On every campaign!” He introduces the toad—his critic—as Gumble. Ormulogun is shockingly insightful with regard to Itkovian, saying, “His bones may well be iron, their burden that of a hundred thousand foundation stones, or souls to be more precise . . . though I capture all he is on the canvas . . . in that image you will see that Itkovian is not yet done.” Gumble then speaks, telling Itkovian “I speak on behalf of the tongue-tied multitudes, otherwise known as . . . the rabble. An audience, understand, wholly incapable of self-realization or cogent articulation, and thus possessors of depressingly vulgar tastes when not apprised of what they trulylike, if only they knew it.” Itkovian asks why Ormulogun, as Imperial artist, is painting the outlawed Dujek, and the response is that the outlawry must be recorded, and besides, what else would he do? He then mocks the “so called community” of artists in Pale and their “so-called styles of expression.” When he demands if Gumble saw anything good in Pale, Gumble says a single mosaic, which, since the artist was dead, Gumble could praise “effusively.” Ormulogun calls Gumble a leech and vulture, and Gumble replies he is happy that whatever god it was made him a toad and not an artist. Itkovian leaves them to their arguing and continues down to the river. He plans on going with Brood, Kallor, and Korlat to the city of Lest. He finds the military organization muddled at best, and prefers the “far clearer” hierarchy of the Malazan group, with Dujek clearly in charge, seconded by Whiskeyjack, Taur, and Twist. His thoughts are interrupted by the arrival of Whiskeyjack, who asks if he saw Silverfox and the two marines. Itkovian says they passed him some time ago. The two marines arrive and say Silverfox lost them by riding into a hillside. He sends them back to cross, then privately offers his hand to Itkovian: “Among the soldiers of the Empire . . . where the worn gauntlet is for war and nothing other than war, to remain gauntleted when grasping the hand of another, in peace, is the rarest of gestures.” Itkovian says he understands the significance and that he is honored. Whiskeyjack says he wishes Itkovian were riding with the Malazans so he could get to know him better and when Itkovian says, “we will meet at Maurik,” Whiskeyjack nods and says “until then.” But as he rides off, Itkovian, looking at him, has a grim feeling it is the last time he will see him.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Quick Ben has been using his warrens to help transport due to the lack of barges. Kruppe, after telling Quick he plans on traveling with the Malazan group, says he is impressed by the wizard’s mastery of so many warrens, as well as how “pristine” the warrens are. He calls Quick’s use of magic a “bold challenge” to the Chained God. Talamandas, invisible (allegedly) on Quick Ben’s soldier, has been complaining that Quick is making himself a target, too noticeable. When Quick Ben tells him to be quiet, Kruppe wonders why Quick Ben is being so harsh to him [Kruppe], and Quick says he was just talking to himself, and will continue to do so. “Thinking out loud,” he tells Talamandas he is purposely being noticeable in order to “kick the hornet nests.” Kruppe then hints he sees Talamandas on Quick’s shoulder, though he doesn’t make it clear if that is what he means. The two marines arrive, and then Whiskeyjack, whom Quick Ben has been waiting for as the last of the group.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Coll and Murillio are continuing what has been a daylong, futile, search in Capustan for a priest that can help the Mhybe. They are suddenly attacked by Broach, who knocks out Murillio and sends sorcery toward Coll. Before the magic can strike, it vanishes and a strange figure steps between Coll and Broach. Broach tells him “I can sense the fist of Hood, coiled there in your lifeless chest. He’s kept you here. Wandering.” The stranger corrects Broach, telling him “Not wandering . . . hunting.” Broach objects he and Bauchelain haven’t really taken all that many souls from Hood, and all he is looking for here is the old woman in the wagon. The unknown warrior tells Broach: “Not for you . . . Her spirit awaits. And those of her gathered kin. And the beasts whose hearts are empty . . . You are to release the undead who guard your compound. You and the one named Bauchelain are to leave the city. This night . . . Or I shall descend upon you and claim your souls.” Broach leaves and the undead warrior tells Coll “you are to have my master’s protection . . . the Temple of Hood has been prepared.” When Coll objects that the Mhybe needs help, the warrior tells him it’s the kind of help Coll cannot give. The warrior—now identified in the text as The Knight of Death—tells Coll he does not sleep, cannot remember it. He adds that the Mhybe will not awaken and so the two of them “will have need of each other. Soon.” The Knight reveals he cannot release the swords from his hands and asks Coll if he thinks Broach was right, that he is dead. Coll says yes, he thinks that is true. He asks if the Knight has a name and the Knight says he has forgotten it, but he thinks he was not from this continent. The only thing he recalls of his life was that “I once stood within fire . . . there was pain. Yet I held on . . . I believe I was, I think, sworn to defend a child’s life. But the child was no more. It may be . . . that I failed.” When he thinks perhaps one day his memories will fully return, Coll thinks to himself that the fact they have not is evidence of Hood’s mercy, “For I think there was nothing easy in your life. Or in your death. And it seems he does possess mercy, for he’s taken you far away from all that you once knew, for if I’m not mistaken . . . never mind that strange skin, you’re a Malazan.”</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>On the other side of the river, Gruntle joins Itkovian on the march, saying it looks like the Seer is using a scorched earth defense. Itkovian replies it’s the smart thing to do. When Gruntle wonders if Dujek and Brood realize how many armies the Seer has, Itkovian says it’s true they’ll find the Seer well prepared, but his end is near, based on what he observed. He tells Gruntle, “Cities and governments are but the flowering head of a plant whose stalk is the commonality whose roots are within the earth, drawing the necessary sustenance that maintains the flower.” The Tenescowri—the commonality—are uprooted, dying, cannibalistic, living in a land that was wasted before the Seer needed to do so as defense—”thus, while the flower still blazes its color, it is in fact already dead.” He believes the cities they all march toward are probably empty, that the Seer has concentrated his forces in Coral, where the defenders will have to also turn cannibal, and in fact, he thinks the Tenescowri were “created for that eventual purpose—as food for the soldiers.” Gruntle says that what Itkovian describes is an empire never meant to sustain itself, or even, if as Itkovian suggests, it might do so via conquest and expansion, would be alive “only on its outer, ever-advancing edges, spreading out from a dead core, a core that grew with it.” When Gruntle thinks the division of forces seems kind of pointless, and that the Malazans will be doing a lot of useless marching, Itkovian says there may have been unvoiced reasons for splitting the army in two, such as less unity than presented, or to avoid a clash of strong wills/egos. He further predicts that the attack at Coral won’t last long, will be a single attempt to overwhelm rather than a patient siege. Stonny comes up and tells them to move along.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Picker watches Detoran drag Hedge into her tent and after some back and forth about it with Blend, muses on how so many of the Bridgeburners have been demoted, starting with Whiskeyjack—Detoran once was a Master Sergeant, Mallet led a healer’s cadre, Spindle captained a company of sappers. Blend says, “None of us is what we once was.” Picker replies she was thinking they were all “losers.” Paran joins them and tells them the Black Moranth have found Setta abandoned and filled with dead. Picker wonders why they’re still marching there and Paran says, “Because we’re not marching to Lest.” He informs them Picker is promoted to lieutenant and will command the Bridgeburners in Paran’s absence. He tells her to keep the Bridgeburners together, “no matter what happens.”</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Whiskeyjack meets with Dujek in the command tent. Dujek tells him Artanthos delivered “the orders” to Paran and that the captain “will get the Bridgeburners ready—ready for what they won’t know.” When Dujek seems to under-esteem Paran, Whiskeyjack interrupts and says, “With the loss of Tatter—of Silverfox, I mean, the captain’s value to us can’t be underestimated. No, not just us. The Empire itself . . . Within him is the power to reshape the world . . . maybe there’s no chance of Laseen ever regaining the man’s favor, but at the very least she’d be wise to avoid making the relationship worse.” They both agree, though, that Laseen is probably aware of this already. Dujek says he is worried about not having Quick Ben around (he is going with Paran) and Whiskeyjack answers that “what the wizard has in mind, I agree with him that the less Brood and company know of it the better . . . the wizard’s madness has saved our skins more than once. Dujek apologizes, and says he’s so anxious due to the power of what they’re dealing with: “It was Brood and Rake and the Tiste Andii—and the damned Elder Gods, as well—who were supposed to step into the Crippled God’s path. They’re the ones with countless warrens and frightening levels of potency—not us, not one mortal squad wizard and a young noble born captain who’s already died once. Even if they don’t mess things up, look at the enemies we’ll acquire.” Whiskeyjack says that’s only if their allies don’t understand what they are trying to do and Dujek says “we’re the Malazans, remember? Nothing we do is ever supposed to reveal a hint of our long-term plans—mortal empires aren’t supposed to think that far ahead. And we’re damned good at following that principle, you and I . . . Laseen inverted the command structure for a reason.” Whiskeyjack says it was to ensure “the right people would be there at the ground level when Shadowthrone and Cotillion made their move,” and says all of that should be told to Quick and all the Bridgeburners. But Dujek says no to the latter and that the former probably already figured it out, and when Whiskeyjack asks why Quick Ben sent Kalam after Laseen, Dujek says Kalam needed to be convinced in person by the empress. When Whiskeyjack bemoans his stupidity, Dujek continues to lay it all out:</p><p>“We knew the Crippled God was getting ready to make a move. We knew the gods would make a mess of things. Granted, we didn’t anticipate the Elder Gods getting involved . . . [but] we knew trouble was coming from more than one direction—but how could be have guessed that . . . the Domin was in any way related to . . . the Crippled God? . . . I don’t think it was entirely chance that it was a couple of Bridgeburners who bumped into that agent of the Chained God [Munug] . . . nor that Quick Ben was there . . . Laseen has always understood the value of tactical placement . . . The Crippled God’s warren wanders—it always has . . . And we caught him . . . As for Paran, there’s a certain logic there as well. Tayschrenn was grooming Tattersail in the role of Mistress of the Deck . . . when that went wrong, there was a residual effect—straight to the man closest to her at the time. Not physically, but certainly spiritually . . . the only truly thick-witted player was Bellurdan Skullcrusher . . . What happened between him and Tattersail . . . ranks as one of the worst foul-ups in imperial history. That the role of Master of the Deck fell to a Malazan and not to some Gadrobi herder . . . Oponn’s luck played into our hands there.”</p><p>Whiskeyjack interrupts to say now he’s worried: “We’re playing shadowgames with the Lord of Shadow, rattling the chains of the Crippled God, and now buying Brood more time without him even knowing it, whilst at the same time defying the T’lan Imass.” Dujek says they’ve got no choice, “It’s up to us to keep Laseen’s head above water—and through her the Malazan Empire. If Brood swings his hammer…”</p><p>Whiskeyjack complains it’s left up to the arm she nearly decimated at Pale, which Dujek says “was an accident, and while you didn’t know it at the time, you know it now. Tayschrenn ordered them to remain in the tunnels because he thought it was the safest place.” But Whiskeyjack says, “seemed more like someone wanted us to be a collateral fatality.” Then thinks to himself, “No, not us. Me. Damn you, Dujek, you lead me to suspect you knew more of that than I’d hoped . . . I hope I’m wrong.” When he brings up Darujhistan, Dujek says it was just miscommunication due to Pale, that everyone was rattled by Pale. He says he learned later that Tayschrenn didn’t know then who Nightchill was, but thought she was aiming to get Dragnipur, along with Bellurdan, who seemed to be her pawn. Laseen wouldn’t allow that, and when Nightchill killed A’Karonys (who had told Tayschrenn he suspected Nightchill), then Tayschrenn hit her. He adds that all these screw-ups seemed to begin when the Tlan Imass slaughtered the people of Aren, which Dujek says was ordered not by Laseen but by Shadowthrone to “wreak vengeance on Laseen, to shake her grip on the empire.” Dujek then tells Whiskeyjack he thinks maybe they don’t know as much as they think they do, but Whiskeyjack says Quick Ben is pretty smart and has probably figured out a lot. He tells Dujek Quick is still “willing” and has also made it clear he has a lot of faith in Paran, whom he says is unpredictable based on a host of factors: walking inside Dragnipur, being used by Oponn, having the blood of a Hound of Shadow in him. He says Laseen shouldn’t assume she can “use him.” When Dujek asks if Whiskeyjack likes Paran, Whiskeyjack says he admires his “resilience, his ability to examine himself with a courage that his ruthless, and most of all for his inherent humanity.” He also confesses his desire to retire after this war, a desire Dujek says he’d expected. When Whiskeyjack wonders if Laseen will let him, Dujek says they shouldn’t let her make the decision. Whiskeyjack asks if he should drown like Crust and Urko, or be seen killed then have his body vanish like Dassem. He adds one day he’ll force the truth about them from Duiker. Dujek asks if Quick Ben has heard from Kalam and Whiskeyjack says not that he knows of. As he rises to leave (noting his aching leg) he asks about the Black Moranth and Dujek says they’ll arrive in two days. Before he leaves, Dujek tells him Tayschrenn wants to apologize and has been waiting for the “proper moment.” They say good night.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Korlat is waiting outside Whiskeyjack’s tent and they enter together. Whiskeyjack asks if she’s found Silverfox and she tells him no; Silverfox travels paths Korlat didn’t even know existed. Korlat was escorted back by two Ay, creatures she confesses disturb her greatly, even more than the T’lan Imass do: “There is, within the T’lan Imass, an emptiness . . . Within these wolves, I see sorrow. Eternal sorrow.” As she speaks, Whiskeyjack thinks what she sees in the Ay is the same he sees in her—”it is the reflection—the recognition—that has shaken you so.” She tells him when she watched them fall into dust, “I don’t know why, but that disturbed me more than anything else.” His response is only inside his mind: “Because it is what awaits all of us. Even you.” He tells her forget it and come to bed, especially as it will be awhile before they can do this again. She says Crone has returned from scouting and then stops before saying more that she clearly wanted to. Whiskeyjack guesses it is about how the cities in the Domin are all empty, and yet the armies are dividing and marching separately anyway, though neither would admit why. Whiskeyjack wonders where Moon’s Spawn is (the Moranth have been searching for it), if the Malazans will arrive to find Coral taken and the Seer killed by Dragnipur. And he thinks then that the Malazans have their own secrets, such as their plan to send Paran and the Bridgeburners ahead and “a lot more than that.” He tells Korlat she matters more to him than anyone or anything and she tells him not to apologize for what has yet to happen. The scene closes by flash-forwarding: “Later, Whiskeyjack would think back on his words, and wish they had been cleaner,—devoid of hidden intent.”</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Paran watches Quick Ben finish a conversation with Haradas (the Trygalle mage). When Quick Ben rejoins him, Paran tells him “the sappers will howl,” and Quick responds that he’ll talk to Hedge: “After all, Fiddler’s closer than a brother to him, and with the mess that Fid’s got into (the events at the close of DG) he needs all the help he can get. The only question is whether the Trygalle can deliver the package in time.” Paran asks if it was more than munitions and Quick Ben says yes, he added a little something due to the desperation of the situation in Seven Cities. Kruppe joins them, having “overheard,” and tells them the people of Darujhistan would like to contribute. He drops a ball that releases a bhok’arala messenger from Baruk. Quick Ben says he’d be happy to accept, but has to wonder what motivates Baruk. The Bhok’arala spits out “Great! Danger! Azath! Icarium! More! Coltaine! Admire! Allies! Yes!” They are interrupted by a female rider who asks to speak with Paran in private. She is the Destriant of the Grey Swords and wants to claim Anaster to let Itkovian take his pain. At first Paran says the Malazans won’t release him to torture, and when she explains what she wants to do, while admitting Anaster will think it is torture because he feels he has nothing but his pain, Paran says she can have him with “his blessing.” She staggers physically at that, telling Paran “There was weight to your use of that word . . . you would be well advised to, uh, exercise caution in the future.” As she leaves, Paran thinks to himself: “Take it as a warning and nothing more. You did nothing to Anaster—you don’t even know the man. A warning, and you’ll damn well heed it.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER TWENTY TWO</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.18624567803090164">As Toc listens, the Seerdomin tells the Seer the Matron is getting worse and that Toc cannot walk anymore. Toc thinks to himself, “there is a wolf . . . trapped in this cage—my chest, these bones . . . The wolf cannot call . . . call . . . To whom? I’d rested my hand once on her furred shoulder . . . So close, traveling in step, yet not awakened . . . such tragic ignorance.” The Seerdomin warns that if Toc is returned to the Matron she will kill him and the Seer becomes angered at the Seerdomin’s impertinence. The Seer asks a bystander—the Septarch Ultentha—who tells the Seer to relieve Toc of his horror, but the Seer refuses: “He is mine! He is Mother’s! She needs him—someone to hold—she needs him!” The Seer threatens to kill them if they persist, then tells them to leave Toc there and asks for reports. Ultentha discusses defense plans. The Seer says he wants Brood’s hammer, Brood dead, Malazans wiped out, and Itkovian delivered as replacement for Toc. The Seer wonders why the armies remain divided despite the Ravens having discovered the empty cities. When the Septarch discusses disease, the Seer says the Domin soldiers will be protected by Poliel, though he cannot say why she does so when the Seerdomin asks. Toc, somewhat crazed, laughs and the Seer wants to know what amuses him. Toc tells him Dujek’s army is the deadliest one in the Empire and it is coming for him, something the Matron senses if the Seer does not. The Seer says the Matron does not fear the Malazans, but is frightened by the ancient terror of Moon’s Spawn. Not Rake and the Andii, who co-opted the flying keep and, according to the Seer, don’t know close to all its abilities, but by the memories it brings up of the K’chain Nah-rhuk—the Short-Tails—who waged war on the K’chain Che’Malle. He says her fears are instinctual and groundless as Moon’s Spawn is nowhere near, possibly even destroyed. His condors have searched for it and found nothing. The Seer says he is breaking all of Toc’s faiths one by one, until all he has left is hope the Seer is merciful. The Seer commands the Seerdomin to return Toc and when he brings him back, he tells Toc the Matron’s chain does not allow her to reach the entire room and he will put Toc out of reach, bring him food, water, and a blanket, saying the Seer will be too distracted to notice. When Toc says, “He will have you devoured,” Seerdomin replies, “I was devoured long ago.” Toc says he is sorry to hear that and the Seerdomin is moved by Toc’s compassion. Toc asks if ice still chokes the sea and the Seerdomin says some “unexpected twist” has cleared the harbor, though there is still ice and raging storms out in the bay.</span></p><p>SCENE 2</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.18624567803090164">Envy and Lanas speak on the Meckros City, now roughly 20 leagues from Coral Envy thinks. When Envy mentions Tool, Lanas says she saw him only once, when he spoke out against the ritual. When Envy says Lanas must hate him, she replies no, they merely disagreed and he acquiesced to the majority. Lanas adds that it is typically thought that “truth is proved by weight of numbers. That what the many believe to be right, must be so. When I see Onos T’oolan once more, I will tell him: he was the one who was right.” Envy mentions she’d been wondering why the Seguleh haven’t challenged Lanas and tell the T’lan that it turns out Seguleh will not fight women unless attacked. She warns Lanas therefore not to do so, saying Tool had some trouble with Senu and Thurule and was probably evenly matched by Mok. When Envy continues, complaining about how Garath is still angry with her, Lanas says it is because “the ay has awakened.” Envy says she’s aware of that, and that she feels bad for the wolf-gods: “an eternity alone.” Lanas asks who granted the ay this “edged gift” and Envy answers: “A misguided sibling who’d thought he was being kind . . . had found the goddess, terribly damaged by the Fall, and needed a warm-blooded place to lay her spirit so that it could heal.” When Lanas says Envy’s sibling has a “misplaced sense of mercy,” Envy agrees.</span></p><p>SCENE 3</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.18624567803090164">At Lest, Korlat watches as Crone angrily reports to Kallor, telling him “You still do not grasp the gravity of this! Fool! Ox! Where is Anomander Rake? . . . I must speak with him—warn him . . . [that] unknown sorcery lies within those abominable vultures [the Seer’s condors].” When she says the Ravens are being kept away from Coral and that the Seer is preparing, Kallor says of course they are. Crone demands to know where Moon’s Spawn is and when nobody answers, she panics, telling Korlat Rake has failed and “taken three-quarters of the Tiste Andii with him!” Brood asks what is happening with the Malazans and she says they’re close to Setta. Kallor takes their unexpected pace as a sign of deception. Brood tells Crone to keep an eye on Dujek’s army and to have faith in Rake. Korlat’s attention wanders and she realizes it has been doing that a lot lately, that her only concern centers on Whiskeyjack, whom she loves. She recalls the first time she saw him, riding to the parley and how he’d caught her eye even then. She is still stunned that Rake calls him “friend,” something she has known him to do with only one other—Brood—with whom he had forged such close ties of friendship over centuries and then millennia, unlike the speed of his friendship with Whiskeyjack. She thinks they share something of spirit, though she admits she cannot see it: “Anomander Rake cannot be reached out to, cannot be so much as touched—not his true self. I have never known what lies behind my Lord’s eyes. I have but sensed its vast capacity—but not the flavor of all that it contains. But Whiskeyjack . . . while I cannot see all that is within him, I can see the cost of containment. The bleeding but not the wound. And I can see his strength.” Crone continues bemoaning the state of things, wondering where Silverfox and the Mhybe are, why the Grey Swords and Gruntle’s legion march so far behind the rest, why the Malazans were so quick to divide the army, where Rake is, and even if the Andii are alive. The scene closes with Korlat begging Whiskeyjack—the “thief of her thoughts” to never release her.</span></p><p>SCENE 4</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.18624567803090164">Itkovian and Gruntle watch two scouts approach to make a report to the Shield Anvil and Destriant. Stonny tells them they’re dumb for watching and wondering and she rides off to find out what the report is about. As the two men wait for her return, Itkovian muses on how Gruntle—with his indifference to discipline or a sense of hierarchy and the way he despises anything military—is his total opposite. Stonny returns and tells them Bauchelain and Broach’s carriage is riding behind them. When he asks about Buke and she says he isn’t there, Gruntle rides off toward the necromancers. Stonny asks Itkovian to go with him. As they ride, Itkovian tells Gruntle he once offered to take Buke’s burden but he refused. Gruntle says Itkovian should have done it anyway, as the new Shield Anvil did with Anaster, who now rides beside her, though Itkovian says he is “but a shell. There was naught else within him but pain. It’s taking has stolen his knowledge of himself,” and asks if that’s really what Gruntle would want for Buke. They reach the necromancers’ carriage and when Gruntle questions him, Reese tells him Buke flew away, which calms Gruntle. Bauchelain steps out and asks what they want, warning them he’s short-tempered. Gruntle says they got what they wanted and before they leave, Itkovian asks Bauchelain why he doesn’t do something for Reese’s toothache. Bauchelain sighs and says he’ll tell Broach to get ready for another surgery, upbraiding Reese for this being the third tooth he’s broken eating olives. Reese turns white and begs no more surgery. Gruntle and Itkovian ride away. When Itkovian asks why Gruntle is laughing, Gruntle tells him Reese will curse him forever, because sometimes the cure is worse than the disease.</span></p><p>SCENE 5</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.18624567803090164">Inside Hood’s temple, Coll and Murillio wait while Death’s Knight prepares the Mhybe’s place. Coll thinks depressing thoughts. A poet’s snippet: “The world spins about us unseen. The blind dance in circles. There’s no escaping what you are, and all your dreams glittered white at night but grey in the light of day.” Of Simtal telling him she was pregnant before she’d destroyed his earlier life, though he does not know if there actually had been a child, and if so, what happened to it. He asks Murillio who tells him there were rumors and he thinks she had a child and sent it away. They didn’t tell Coll because he was a drunk and a wreck. Coll says he’ll have Baruk help him find the child. Murillio tells him he can’t just claim it out of whoever’s house the child is in, plus he says Coll can’t raise a child, though he could be a “hidden benefactor.” The Knight returns and leads them to a large hole in the room’s center where the Mhybe will go, and it looks like a sarcophagus to Coll and Murillio.</span></p><p>SCENE 6</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.18624567803090164">The Mhybe dreams. The tundra and hunters have disappeared and she wanders “desolation . . . no grasses underfoot, no sweet cool wind. The hum of the blackflies was gone . . . The sky overhead was colorless, devoid of cloud or even sun.” She is weakening and feels she will soon dissolve. She thinks now that “nothing had been as it had seemed—it had all been something different, something secret, a riddle she’d yet to work out. And now it was too late. Oblivion had come for her . . . Perhaps those visions had been the products of her own mind after all.” She comes across a towering mass of bones, “a cage of ribs, each rib scarred, knotted with malignant growths . . . Between each bone, sing was stretched, enclosing whatever was within.” She wonders if it is her heart inside and wants to flee, but the “it” inside senses her, “demanded that she stay . . . that she come closer . . . touch . . . then it began to pull. And the land beneath her shifted, tilted . . . the ribs were no ribs no longer. They were legs. And skin was not skin. It had become a web. And she was sliding.”</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter 23 (Part 1):</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Paran and Picker await the return of a scouting group into Setta. Quick Ben joins them and tells Paran Twist’s infection is worsening and he’ll probably only live a few weeks. Antsy reports Setta is empty save for big piles of human bones from feasts and huge condor’s nests on the towers. Paran says they’re bypassing Maurik (which had been the plan) and heading for Coral. Antsy says the sappers are worried about being undersupplied with munitions, especially since Quick Ben sent a bunch to Fiddler. Picker says if what they have isn’t enough, more won’t make much difference. Paran dismisses the group to prepare. Twist arrives and asks Paran if he blessed the Barghast gods. Paran says not yet, but he “acknowledges their place in the pantheon.” When asked why he wants to know, Twist says he wants to know what will happen to his soul. Paran asks what caused the split between Barghast and Moranth, and Twist says the Moranth do not fear or resist change and the Barghast must come to accept that change and growth are necessary for life. He says they have to learn what the Moranth did long ago when rather than fight the Tiste Edur they spoke to them, and learned they were as lost, as tired of war, as ready for peace as the Moranth. Paran asks who the Edur are and Twist explains the “Children of the Shattered Warren. A fragment had been discovered in the vast forest of the Moranth that would become our new homeland. Kurald Emurlahn, the true face of Shadow . . . The last of them are gone now from Moranth Wood, long gone, but their legacy is what has made us as we are . . . We did not slay the Tiste Edur. In Barghast eyes, that is our greatest crime.” When Moranth wonders if the Elder spirits—the newly become gods—feel the same way, Paran says they’ve had a lot of time to think: “Sometimes that’s all that’s needed. The heart of wisdom is tolerance, I think.” Twist replies that Paran, then, must be proud. He adds that he thinks the Malazan Empire is “wise” and he wishes it and Paran well. As he watches Twist leave, Paran thinks to himself: “Tolerant. Maybe. Keep that word in mind, Ganoes—there’s a whisper that it will prove the fulcrum in what’s to come.”</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Kruppe rides (or is carried by his mule) into the Barghast tent. Hetan asks if he’s noticed something odd about the Malazan numbers, that they seem to be pretending there are more soldiers in the camps than there really are. She also tells Kruppe that she plans on bedding him soon, and then gives him some advice on his mule: “Settle in that saddle as if it were a horse, for it believes itself to be so . . . Its eyes never rest—have you not noticed? This is the most alert beast this world has ever seen, and don’t ask me why.”</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>The two marines who had been watching Silverfox ask to rejoin their company and Whiskeyjack says no. When they leave, Artanthos remarks that Dassem’s command style—letting soldiers think, question, argue—sometimes comes back to bite you. Whiskeyjack answers it is why the Malazan armies are the best. Looking at the army, Whiskeyjack realizes they are tired from too many forced quick marches and he’ll have to pace them for Coral. He reports to Dujek the army is tired. The two discuss how the army is dividing—by tonight they’ll each command (separately) roughly half the army. When Whiskeyjack says he’s the one who should fly out tonight due to the risk involved, Dujek says Whiskeyjack is and has always been more important to the army. He tells Whiskeyjack that Seven Cities is in full rebellion and that the Adjunct is going with an army but it will be too late for the Malazans already there. Laseen, he adds, has only two commanders who know anything about Seven Cities and one veteran army—so she knows Dujek is the one to risk in the Pannion war. Whiskeyjack is shocked Laseen might send the Host to Seven Cities and Dujek replies that if the Adjunct falls, what choice does she have? He adds Laseen wants Whiskeyjack to command it while she either thinks Dujek won’t survive the Pannion war or perhaps she’ll send him to the campaign in Korel, which isn’t going well. Whiskeyjack reiterates his intention to retire and when Dujek fondly mocks Whiskeyjack’s vision of domestic bliss and asks if Korlat would settle for that, Whiskeyjack says it’s her idea. Dujek says fine, he’ll take the army to Seven Cities. He asks if Whiskeyjack will share “one last meal” with him and when both realize how that sounds, explains he meant, “One last meal before I leave, I meant.”</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Paran flies over the approach to Coral, thinking on their task to figure out the Seer’s preparations and deal with them, “and once that’s done, it’ll be time for me and Quick Ben . . . ” His thought is interrupted by the discovery of some dead creature on the river bank. Paran at first takes the corpse as a Tiste Andii, but upon examination Quick Ben says he doesn’t thinks so as his skin is too pale. He says the death looks like something caused by a spell of Serc that uses huge pressure to burst the body from the inside out. The Moranth captain identifies the corpse as a Tiste Edur. The captain and Quick Ben agree on several points: the Edur he didn’t die in this spot, didn’t drown and wasn’t killed by sorcery. The Moranth says the Blue Moranth are seafolk and sometimes bring up fish from deep trenches that arrive dead already from the change in pressure. He says the Edur died from the opposite—killed by suddenly appearing in a place of great pressure. Quick Ben agrees and says there is a nearby deep trench in the middle of the river. Paran says that means the Edur opened a warren and stepped into the trench, which seems a complicated way to commit suicide. Quick Ben points out Paran is assuming the Edur intended to appear in the trench or was the one who opened the warren, saying one way to kill someone is to shove them through a portal into a bad place—he thinks the Edur was murdered that way, most likely by a High Mage of Ruse—the Path of the Sea. He calls it the hardest warren to master and says there isn’t a true Ruse High Mage in all the empire. The Moranth says they have none either. Paran interrupts that he just got a hunch that the Edur was killed by another Edur. The three discuss the warren of Shadow. The Moranth says it was broken and “lost to mortals” to which Quick Ben, says “never found you mean.” They agree where Shadowthrone and Cotillion are—Meanas—is “naught but a gateway”, prompting Paran to say, “If a shadow could cast a shadow, that shadow would be Meanas . . . Shadowthrone rules the guardhouse?” Paran says that’s a “disturbing” idea, and thinks, “The Hounds of Shadow—they are the guardians of the gate . . . But the warren is also shattered. Meaning that gate might not lead anywhere. Or maybe it belongs to the largest fragment. Does Shadowthrone know the truth?” Quick Ben says he understands why Paran finds it disturbing: “The Tiste Edur are active once more . . . returning to the mortal-world—perhaps they’ve reawakened the true Throne of Shadow and maybe they’re about to pay their new gatekeeper a visit. Paran wonders if it means “another war in the pantheon.” He moves off and puts himself back in the Azath map room. He decides he wants not the Deck of Dragons but the “Elder Deck, the Deck of Holds.” He transports to the Throne of Shadow and is surprised to find it is in his own world: “A small, tattered fragment of Kurald Galain and the Tiste Edur have come to find it. They’re searching, crossing the seas, seeking this place.” Shadows tell him “The wandering isle. Wanders not. Flees. Yes! The Children are corrupted, the souls of the Edur are poisoned! Storms of madness we elude! Protect us!” Paran realizes he is on Drift Avalii and says he thought there were Tiste Andii there. The Shadows say they’ve left: “Sworn to defend! Spawn of Anomander Rake—gone! Leaving a blood trail, leading the Edur away with the spilling out of their own lives—oh, where is Anomander Rake? They call for him, they call and call! They beg his help! . . . The Edur have sworn to destroy Mother Dark. You must warn him! Poisoned souls, led by the one who has been slain a hundred times, oh, ware this new Emperor of the Edur, this Tyrant of Pain, this Deliverer of Midnight Tides!” Paran pulls himself out, back to the map chamber, then into Dragnipur. He calls out for Draconus who joins him. Paran says he meant to find Rake and Draconus says Paran found Rake’s sword instead. When Paran says he talked to Nightchill but doesn’t have time to discuss it—he has to talk to Rake—Draconus agrees and says Paran needs to explain the truth to Rake—that Rake is “too merciful to wield Dragnipur. The situation is growing desperate.” Paran asks what he means and Draconus says: “Dragnipur needs to feed.” Too many that pull the wagon are failing and being thrown into the wagon, which makes the burden heavier and slower: “Tell Rake—he must take souls. Powerful ones, preferably. And he must do so soon.” He tells Paran to use his Master’s vision to see what pursues the wagon. Paran sees “Chaos . . . a storm such as he had never seen before. Rapacious hunger poured from it . . . Lost memories. Power born from rendered souls. Malice, and desire, a presence almost self-aware, with hundreds of thousands of eyes fixed on the wagon . . . so eager to feed.” Draconus tells him: “Darkness has ever warred against Chaos . . . ever retreated. And each time that Mother Dark relented—to the Coming of Light, to the Birth of Shadow—her power has diminished, the imbalance growing more profound. Such was the state . . . in those early times . . . Chaos approached the very gate to Kurald Galian itself. A defense needed to be fashioned. Souls were required . . . Chaos hungers for the power in those souls—for what Dragnipur has claimed . . . such power will make it stronger . . . sufficient to breach the Gate. Look to your mortal realm . . . civilization-destroying wars, civil wars, pogrom, wounded and dying gods— . . . your kind progress . . . on the path forged by Chaos. Blinded by rage, lusting for vengeance, those darkest of desires . . . Memories—of humanity, of all that is humane—are lost.” Paran says how can Draconus want Paran to shatter the sword. Draconus answers he has realized over time he spent in the sword that he had made a “grave error.” He says he believed “only in Darkness could the power that is order be manifested. I sought to help Mother Dark—for it seemed she was incapable of helping herself. She would not answer, she would not even acknowledge her children . . . we could not find her . . . Before the Houses, there were Holds. Before Holds, there was wondering . . . but not wandering but migration. A seasonal round—predictable, cyclical. What seemed aimless, random, was in truth fixed, bound to its own laws. A truth—a power—I failed to recognize.” He tells Paran breaking the sword will return the Gate to its migration, to “what gave it strength to resist Chaos.” The sword forced the Gate of Darkness to flight for eternal, but if the souls in the sword weaken/diminish, it cannot flee. He says Rake needs to send more souls to bide time to shatter Dragnipur. He says he’s learned something else as well since he forged the sword: “Just as Chaos possess the capacity to act in its own defense, to indeed alter its own nature to its own advantage in its eternal war, so too can Order. It is not solely bound to Darkness.” Paran guess he’s referring to the Azath Houses and the Deck an Draconus says “The Houses take souls and bind them in place. Beyond the grasp of Chaos.” When Paran says what’s it matter then if Darkness falls, Draconus replies: “Losses and gains accumulate, shift the tide, but not always in ways that redress the balance. We are in an imbalance that approaches a threshold. This war . . . may come to an end. What awaits us all, shout that happen . . . well, mortal, you have felt its breath, there in our wake.” He says Paran must tell Rake this, assuming he is still carrying the sword, which makes Paran wonder what is implied by that idea. Paran goes back to the Azath and tries to find Rake but cannot. He falls unconscious.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>He awakes to find Mallet taking care of him. Quick Ben tells Paran they’ve seen several Condors searching, Paran says they aren’t looking for the Malazans; they’re searching for Moon’s Spawn. When Quick asks how you hide something the size of Moon’s Spawn, Paran tells him he sought Rake through the deck and couldn’t find him; he thinks they’ve lost the Andii, that Rake is gone.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>The other half of the Malazan army passes through Setta. Hetan makes it clear she has been bedding Kruppe for several days. Kruppe says he can’t take much more.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter 23, Part 2</strong></p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Picker looks out onto Coral Bay while Paran and Quick Ben meet with the squad mages Spindle, Shank, Toes, and Bluepearl. Mallet tells her the mages are nervous about the condors and Paran’s news about Rake. He also thinks Quick Ben and Paran have some secret plan, another mission Dujek doesn’t know about, though he implies Whiskeyjack does, and his squad, especially Hedge and Trotts.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Brood’s army is becoming stretched on the way to Maurik, with the Grey Swords and Gruntle’s legion lagging behind, becoming a rear guard. Itkovian has been enjoying his time with Stonny and Gruntle, but feeling more and more an outsider with regard to the Grey Swords. He feels bad for the new Shield Anvil, bearing the burden of the position without the veteran support Itkovian had via Brukhalian and Karnadas. Gruntle tells him Itkovian’s sense of guilt reminds him of Buke, but Itkovian says the difference is “the notion of redemption. I accept torment, such as it is for me, and so acknowledge responsibility for all that I have and have not done. As Shield Anvil, my faith demanded that I relieve others of their pain . . . bring peace to souls . . . without judgment.” When Stonny asks whom he gives the souls to now that Fener is gone, Itkovian says he still carries them. Stonny is angered the new Shield Anvil, who has a god, hasn’t taken them and Itkovian tells her the Shield Anvil offered, but she isn’t ready or strong enough, nor is her god. He says it’s up to him “I must find a means . . . of redeeming them. As my god would have done . . . I must.” They’re interrupted by High Marshal Straw, of the Mott irregulars, who asks where they are marching to and why so fast. Gruntle says Brood is trying to beat the Malazans to Maurik and the Malazans are going quickly for uncertain reasons. Straw says he knows—they have spies with the Malazans—and tells them the Black Moranth are flying whole companies away and that Whiskeyjack’s group is building barges at Maurik River. When asked why he hasn’t told Brood, Straw replies he and the Bole brothers think Brood’s forgotten about them and that Kallor, who had ordered them to go away before the march, has been preventing their people from speaking to Brood. He mentions they’re all getting antsy and even thinking of taking on Bauchelain and Broach. When Gruntle warns they’re necromancers, Straw tells a story of how the Bole brothers killed one back in Mott Woods. Itkovian asks if they should tell Brood about the Malazans and Stonny says what it’s matter, just means Brood’s army will have fewer days to wait at Maurik. Itkovian wonders what he’s doing, why he feels “indifferent, empty of concern” and wonders if he is “done. Finally done.”</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Hetan is complaining about her third day on the barge. Whiskeyjack says another day and they should be at Maurik. Taur asks if he thinks Brood knows and Whiskeyjack says at least partially, noting they have Mott Irregulars with them so they know what the spies know. He tells how the Irregulars were created by the Malazans when they pushed into Mott Woods, where the Irregulars defeated both the Malazans and Gold Moranth several times until Dujek just pulled out, but by then Brood had heard and so recruited them. Taur says one day the Empire will march on the White Face Range and when Whiskeyjack says he doubts it, Taur asks if the Barghast aren’t worthy enough foes. Whiskeyjack tells him “We have treated with you and the Malazan Empire takes such precedents seriously. You will be met with respect and offers to establish trade, borders, and the like—if you so desire. If not, the envoys will depart and that will be the last you ever see of the Malazans until such time as you decide otherwise.” Taur calls them “strange conquerors” and asks why they’re even here on Genabackis. Whiskeyjack says, “We’re here to unify, and through unification grow rich. We’re not selfish about getting rich, either.” Taur asks if they really only care about silver and Whiskeyjack answers “There’s more than one kind of wealth . . . Meeting the White Face clans of the Barghast is one such reward. Diversity is worth celebrating, Humbrall Taur, for it is the birthplace of wisdom.” The last is a quote from Duiker, whom Whiskyjack says speaks for the Empire “in the best of times.” When Hetan complains of sea sickness again, Taur suggests perhaps she is pregnant.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>Korlat rides through Maurik, while Brood, Kallor, and the others ride around. She thinks if Rake is OK, she’ll have to end her service with him, after fourteen thousand years. Then she realizes it will be suspending it, rather than ending it, as Whiskeyjack has only a mortal’s lifespan. If Rake is dead, she’ll be the ranking commander, though only of the dozen or so Andii left—those in Brood’s army. She has already decided she’ll simply free them to their desires. She realizes she doesn’t have the strength or personality Rake has used to unify the Andii. She wonders about all the tasks he has set the Andii to:<br/>The disparate causes in which he chose to engage himself and his people were, she had always assumed, each a reflection upon a single theme—but that theme and its nature had ever eluded Korlat . . . wars . . . enemies, allies, victories and losses. A procession through centuries that seemed random not just to her, but to her kin as well . . . Perhaps Anomander Rake was equally lost. Perhaps this endless succession of cause reflects his own search. I had all along assumed a single goal—to give us a reason to exist, to take upon ourselves the nobility of others—others for whom the struggle meant something . . . Why do I now believe that, if a theme does indeed exist, it is something other? Something far less noble . . . For despair is the nemesis of the Tiste Andii. How often have I seen my kin fall on the field of battle and have known . . . They died because they had chosen to die. Slain by their own despair. Does Anomander Rake lead us away from despair—is that his only purpose . . .? Is his a theme of denial? If so . . . he was right in seeking to keep us from ever realizing his singular, pathetic goal . . . To choose not to share what I had seen as arrogance, as patronizing behavior . . . ah Lord, you held to the hardest mercy. And if despair assails us, it assails you a hundredfold . . . I must needs find the strength . . . to hide the truth from my kin . . . Oh Whiskeyjack . . . The world holds no paradise for you and me . . . All I can offer is that you join me . . . [and] that it will, for you, be enough.</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>Brood, Kallor, Korlat’s second and brother Orfantal, are joined by Korlat as they await the Malazan barges. Korlat marvels at the number of them built so quickly and thinks the Black Moranth must have been involved and that Dujek and Whiskeyjack had planned this for some time. When they land, Brood asks where the rest of the army is. Whiskeyjack says they couldn’t build enough boats so Dujek took half via the Black Moranth to Coral. Kallor and Whiskeyjack insult each other again, then Brood accuses the Malazans of deception. Whiskeyjack answers that since Brood’s group had some secret plan with Rake and Moon’s Spawn, they “started it.” Brood says Moon’s Spawn wasn’t meant to attack Coral alone and gain an advantage on their allies; it was meant to be used in unified effort. Whiskeyjack replies their secret is the same—the Bridgeburners are trying to find out what preparations the Pannion has made while Dujek and his six thousand are following to destroy whatever the Bridgeburners find. Brood sees immediately that Dujek is undermanned and tells Whiskeyjack the Malazans might lose half their army, to which Whiskeyjack says he knows which is why he’s planning on making for Coral with all speed. Kallor suggests letting Dujek get wiped out, especially as the Malazans set themselves up for it. When Korlat calls the idea petty and emotionally motivated, Kallor says of course she’d side with her lover. She says not if his ideas were bad, which is what makes her different from Kallor. She advises Brood to hurry to Coral to relieve Dujek, saying a five-day quick march will do it. Kallor says the army would arrive tired and so they should take eight days. Whiskeyjack says he doesn’t care what they do; he and the Malazans are leaving and hurrying. Korlat asks Brood if he trusts the Andii and he says of course. She then says they will join the Malazans (and the Barghast that are with them). If there is trouble or betrayal, she or Orfantal can take dragon form and return to inform Brood. Kallor insults Korlat again and Orfantal almost comes to blows with him. Brood tells Kallor he trusts the Andii far more than Kallor, whose loyalty he begins to wonder about, and Kallor warns him “beware your fears . . . lest you make them come true,” though he backs down to Brood. Before leaving, Orfantal tells Kallor he thinks one day he will “come for you.” Korlat and Whiskeyjack share a look of love.</p><p>SCENE 12</p><p>Gruntle and Itkovian wait to cross the river (well after the Malazans). As Brood settles to camp, Gruntle wonders at the different pace of the two armies. Gruntle speaks to High Marshal Sty, who tells him while discussing the barges that Whiskeyjack was once apprenticed as a mason. While Gruntle is trying to convince a Rhivi herder to let his group cross first, Sty knocks out a Rhivi guard and steals a pile of dung.</p><p>SCENE 13</p><p>Whiskeyjack and the others slog onward through rain, two days still to Coral. He looks forward to some time with Korlat later. She and the Andii are trying to use Kurald Galain, trying to purge it of the CG’s poison before battle. He thinks she is different in her command role: “some bleak resolve has hardened all that was within her. Perhaps it was the possible death of Anomander Rake . . . perhaps it was their future paths they had so naively entwined without regard for the harsh demands of the real world.” He is certain Rake is not dead or lost, trusting utterly he will be there at the attack on Coral simply because he had said he would. As he watches the storm come to an end, he thinks he is pushing the army too hard, and admits to himself he was more shaken by Brood’s loss of faith and unwillingness to march with them than he let on to others. He wonders if this was all a “fatal” mistake.</p><p>SCENE 14</p><p>Kallor watches muddy water flow always south and even uphill, and thinks it is the T’lan Imass: “so you march with us after all. No, understand, I am pleased.” He goes to Brood and says he was wrong; they should have gone to relieve Dujek. While Brood will have to wait to morning to speed up, Kallor says he will go now and offer his experience: “I have walked this land when the T’lan Imass were but children. I have commanded armies a hundred thousand strong. I have spread the fire of my wrath across entire continents and sat alone upon tall thrones. Do you grasp the meaning of this?” Brood’s answer: “Yes. You never learn, Kallor.” When Brood continues, saying the Malazans seem to be doing fine without Kallor, Kallor tells him he hasn’t been defeated with his blade drawn in a hundred thousand years. Not so impressed, Brood notes that Kallor is always very choosy about whom he draws that blade on, pointing out he hasn’t challenged Rake, Dassem, Greymane, the Seguleh First. Kallor says he won’t have to worry about any of them. Though Brood is a bit surprised and suspicious perhaps by Kallor’s newfound “zeal,” he gives him permission to go. Kallor leaves, smiling.</p><p>SCENE 15</p><p>Envy’s group finally lands. Lanas Tog says a group of about 20-50 walked here four days earlier, heading for Coral. She adds they were tracked by a predator—a large cat. They move toward Coral.</p><p>SCENE 16</p><p>Paran and the Bridgeburners have discovered trenches and tunnels filled with weapons—preparations for defense. They’ve spotted a group of 400 or so Pannions coming to stand guard in the command tunnel area. Paran tells Spindle to rig the tunnels to blow if the Bridgeburners get pushed out, then use the rest to booby-trap the approach to the tunnels and also make it appear as if there are a lot more Malazans than the 40 of them. The mage cadre says they’ll take out the sorcerer with the Pannions. They see the other plans.</p><p>SCENE 17</p><p>A little later, Paran is watching the Malazan mages at work as the Pannions approach. Shank takes out the Pannion sorcerer, the sappers (Hedge, Spindle, others) toss munitions, setting afire trees they’d drenched in oil, and the Pannions trapped there. Paran thinks, “We’re not a friendly bunch, are we?” Looking at Quick Ben, Paran thinks he sees a tiny stick figure, but it disappears and he thinks he’s just seeing things. The fire starts to go out and the screams have stopped. Paran looks at the corpses and thinks: “if Hood has reserved a pit for his foulest servants, then the Moranth who made these munitions belong in it. And us, since we’ve used them. This was not battle. This was slaughter.” Mallet joins them and says Dujek is arriving via Black Moranth bringing in waves of soldiers. Paran says good, anticipating the Pannion sending a stronger force to retake the tunnels now that he knows the Malazans are there.</p><p><strong>Chapter 24</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Coll watches as two masked priests-Rath’Togg and Rath’Fanderay—approach the temple of Hood. He is joined by Rath’Shadowthrone. Murillio and Baudin let the two priests into the temple and when Rath’Shadowthrone is about to join Coll in going in, Coll punches him, knocking him unconscious so he won’t spy. Coll enters to see everyone sitting/standing around the Mhybe’s prepared spot—all of them “waiting.”</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Picker and Antsy’s squad are scouting out the gate into Coral. They watch 25-30,000 soldiers, a cadre of mages, and a Septarch exit heading for Dujek’s army. They hope the Seer won’t try to annihilate Dujek, but they fear it’s just what he’ll try to do, before any reinforcements show.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Quick Ben assembles his mages and tells them he’ll deal with most of the Seer’s sorcerers and they’ll handle whatever gets past him. But Dujek worries that’s not enough, and they are also low on munitions. He sees it as a choice between staying to take out 10, 000 or so of the enemy and possibly getting annihilated or just blowing the hillside and retreating. When Paran says that’s up to Dujek, Dujek says it isn’t and looks at Quick Ben. Quick thinks: “I made a promise to Burn. The captain and I had plans. To keep all that . . . we blow the entrenchments and scamper. But then again, I’m a soldier. A Bridgeburner . . . it’s more than a fair exchange. We make it for Whiskeyjack. For the siege to come. We save lives.” And he tells Dujek “it’s a fair exchange.” When Paran and Dujek leave, Quick Ben asks what Blend wants (meaning he can see her) and she tells him she picked up a charm that makes it hard for her to be noticed and maybe it can help Quick. He tells her to keep it and go back to her squad and keep an eye out for the condors. When she leaves, he laughs that her charm is a worthless piece of stone; it’s her inborn talent that keeps her unnoticed.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Picker’s squad watches the Pannion front line heading up the ramp toward the entrenchments, protected by their sorcerer’s magic. Picker thinks Quick Ben isn’t enough to handle this, that he’s been good in the past because he does it all in the shadows; he’s no Tattersail or Hairlock, she thinks. Demons suddenly appear among the legions and Blend tells Picker they’re illusions. Even so, because the soldiers believe, they are killed by the demons. The Seerdomin mages attack the “demons” and Quick Ben “kills” them off. The mages then send magic toward Quick Ben’s position and Blend worries he was killed. Another Quick Ben illusion kills some mages then the solders start to move into the trees alongside the ramp—heading for Picker’s squad.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Paran watches Quick Ben appear out of a warren, smoking from sorcerous attack. A messenger tells Paran the legions are heading up through the woods and Paran tells him to pass the word and also tell the soldiers to be aware that Picker’s squad will be coming up ahead of the Pannion soldiers. Quick Ben uses magic to pull up boulders and rocks from the ground, turn them red-hot, and send shadows among them—preparing an avalanche for the enemy. When the Seerdomin mages send waves of sorcery up ahead, Quick Ben opens a warren and redirects the magical attack against the Pannion soldiers. He then let’s loose the avalanche he’d prepared, killing lots of the enemy while avoiding the Malazans. Meanwhile, the sappers and regular soldiers are using munitions and arrows to kill even more. Then a wall of sorcery from a condor kills a lot of Malazans. The Black Moranth try to attack it but are wiped out. Quick Ben grabs Paran and tells him to draw the bird (as a card) on the ground. He does and Quick Ben “thumps” it with his fist and the condor drops to the ground. Quick and Paran go after it but when they’re attacked by another mage and Quick Ben takes them via warren into the river then out, Paran loses his sword. When they reach the condor, Paran pulls his dagger out and when Quick Ben uses an illusion to distract the condor, Paran stabs it but to no avail. He feels the hound rising in him and as Quick Ben watches, he sees “Paran almost invisible within a writhing, shadow-woven Hound. Not a Soletaken—not a veering—these are two creatures—man and beast—woven together somehow. And the power behind it—it’s Shadow. Kurald Emurlahn.” Paran kills the condor, though he is badly wounded and then falls unconscious.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Picker is amazed at all Quick Ben has done, thinking it was as if a “dozen High Mages had showed up to give him a hand . . . Or a god.” Blend appears and Picker tells her to collect the squad.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Paran wakes and Mallet tells him they survived and Dujek is assembling the army. Mallet says he was sent to heal him but Paran says take care of those who are worse off first. When Mallet objects that Dujek gave the order, Paran says, “I’ll carry my scars.” Paran goes to the command area where Dujek, Quick Ben, and Picker are. Dujek asks if Mallet found him and when Paran says yes, Dujek tells him he’ll be “seamed with scars.” Dujek then informs him that the Pannions retreated, probably because Whiskeyjack and Brood are coming fast. He then says the trenches are indefensible, he won’t get more Moranth killed by trying to send messages to the other armies (the condors are wiping out the Moranth fliers), and so he’s sending the Bridgeburners into Coral to breach a hole in the keep’s wall. They’re to pull out then. Dujek’s group will be coming in behind the Bridgeburners.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Korlat rides to Whiskeyjack, who asks her what Kallor had said upon arriving. She tells him he offered an apology from him and Brood, and the use of his sword and tactical wisdom. She says it “leaves me uneasy.” The two ride to a ridge overlooking Coral and look to the area where the battle of the entrenchments was fought (they saw flashes of sorcery from the battle). Whiskeyjack says that’s where he would have set up an army to deal with an incoming siege and Dujek must have messed up those plans. He thinks Dujek was driven back or is surrounded and says his army needs to pull the Seer’s attention away from Dujek and give him a chance to regroup. Korlat says the army is exhausted and he replies nonetheless—he wants them lined up on the ridge in clear sight. And asks that she and Orfantal take their dragon form. She says her brother wants to go to Dujek and maybe drive off the condors, but Whiskeyjack worries his presence will draw them and he’d rather have the two of them together to guard each other. Korlat says she and Orfantal are pretty formidable even alone, and Dujek has great need. She’ll stay and guard the Whiskeyjack’s army and Orfantal will fly to Dujek. Whiskeyjack says he worries about her and then asks her if she’s sensed Rake at all. She says no. As they turn away, they just miss sight of the Black Moranth taking the Bridgeburners into Coral.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>The Bridgeburners get dropped off near the keep. On their way, they noticed a lot of condors on the roof. Hedge says the sappers can take them out and Paran orders them into position. They also plan to bring down a section of the wall. Paran thinks the sappers won’t be able to take out all the condors, and so wants Quick Ben to create another diversion by taking the two of them and Antsy’s group to the roof so the condors don’t attack Dujek’s army. He asks Quick Ben what the condors actually are and Quick speculates they were once actual condors but the Seer put chaos-aspected demons inside them so they are both demon and bird, with the demon having mastery. Paran asks which one does the flying and Quick Ben sees where he’s going. Toes uses his specialty and uses ghosts to carry grappling hooks/rope up to get the sappers into position. Undead K’Chain Che’Malle begin heading out of the keep’s gate towards where Dujek will be attacking. Paran orders Picker’s group to divert them. When he tells her to stay together, she says they’ll probably have to scatter to deal with the K’Chain. She and Paran make a bet on who will die first. Before leaving, she tells Paran “those knives at your back? They’ve been turned the other way for some time. Just wanted to let you know.” He thanks her. Quick Ben opens a Kurald Galain warren and takes them up to the keep’s roof behind the sleeping condors, a dozen of which suddenly exploded from Hedge’s sharpshooters. The others wake and rise to fly when Spindle opens his warren and the suddenly terrified condor-half of the possessed creatures start fighting with the demons for control of their body, letting the soldiers shoot them with crossbows. Then an entire tower is taken down by the sappers. The demons start to regain control of the condors (seemingly not too affected by the crossbows) and Paran’s group runs to the other side of the roof.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>At the west wall, Tool takes shape and faces the wall. Rather than fall into dust and go over it or under, he decides he will announce his arrival by going through it.</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>Dujek’s second wave enters the city. Dujek watches as a wave of sorcery from three condors wipes out a thousand Black Moranth and five companies of his army. Hundreds of Moranth take down the condors via suicide attacks. He orders his men to take defensible buildings rather than aim for the keep and then sends a message to Twist asking him to make a single pass overhead, and warning him they probably won’t make it back, so he should keep a wing in reserve.</p><p>SCENE 12</p><p>The condors on the keep roof are looking for Paran’s group but Quick Ben is managing to keep them hidden. They feel the keep wall being breached again, but not by munitions. Over the ice-filled bay, spouts are exploding and a storm seems to be forming. Paran’s group watches as a wing of Moranth drop heavy munitions on the city then are almost completely wiped out by a half-dozen condors. They worry the munitions may also have killed the Bridgeburners.</p><p>SCENE 13</p><p>Picker’s group is down to twenty-two, with three of them possibly fatally wounded. They’re attacked by another K’Chain but before it can close on them, the wall explodes and another K’Chain falls through, destroyed. Tool steps out and takes out the K’Chain that was threatening Picker’s squad. He heads for the keep and Picker tells everyone to follow him.</p><p>SCENE 14</p><p>Whiskeyjack’s army lines up before the field in front of the city. They had watched the battle and know Dujek is getting wiped out. As they look on, eight hundred K’Chain exit the gate. Korlat thinks how they’re going to get wiped out themselves to “occupy” the attention “for a time” of the K’Chain, so fewer are busy killing Dujek’s army. She thinks Brood’s group are too far behind, the Grey Swords closer but still too late, and Gruntle’s legion seems to have disappeared. She is not surprised the Seer is holding back 20 condors over the keep as the K’Chain are most likely more than enough. When she says the Andii will take first shot at the K’Chain, Kallor mocks her with the fact that the Andii warren is still poisoned and would require a full unveiling—”by all your kin, not just the ones here, to achieve a cleansing. Your brothers and sisters are about to be slaughtered.” She thinks Kallor knows too much of the Andii. Whiskeyjack looks to Artanthos, whose attention is fixed on the plain. The two marines appear and say they found Silverfox, and then the T’lan Imass army appears in front of the K’Chain Che’Malle. Silverfox heads toward Artanthos and then Kallor swings his sword at Korlat. She is struck and hits the ground, feeling a chaotic warren. She watches as Kallor charges toward Silverfox, chaotic magic surrounding him. Silverfox calls out for the Ay to defend her, but they do not appear. Whiskeyjack steps in front of her and engages Kallor. Kallor steps wrong and Whiskeyjack leans forward to stab him but his leg buckles and Kallor kills him. Kallor is shot by two crossbow bolts from the two marines, who then attack him, but are killed, though not before wounding him badly in the gut. He calls out for the Chained God to heal him. Korlat senses another warren, a “hot” one, opening and then sees Kallor attacked by sorcerous fire. Another warren opens and whisks Kallor away. Silverfox kneels over Korlat and tells her to hold on, that Brood is coming to heal her and that Orfantal, in dragon form, is approaching. Artanthos stands over her and Silverfox, identifying him as Tayschrenn, bitterly asks him if the “sorcery that accompanied Kallor’s betrayal was truly so efficacious as to leave you stunned for so long? Or did you hold back? Calculating your moments, observing the consequences of your inaction?” Tayschrenn answers, “Please. I would not,” and when Silverfox says, “Wouldn’t you?” replies “No.” Tayschrenn is badly wounded by chaos and Korlat knows it was more than she could have handled, knows Tayschrenn did not hold back, and thinks that he had done anything at all was “extraordinary.” She tells Silverfox to thank him for saving her life. Korlat thinks “He is yours, now. Hood. Do you smile? My love is yours.”</p><p>SCENE 15</p><p>Itkovian’s mount is failing after Gruntle had woken him before dawn and told him something had gone wrong and they needed to get to Coral fast. Gruntle’s legion went on foot, using Trake’s power to go faster than Itkovian and Stonny could ride. When Itkovian asked what makes Gruntle so nervous, he tells Itkovian he thinks they’re going to be betrayed. He and his legion formed into a large tiger shape and speed away, with Stonny and Itkovian riding after. They reach Coral and arrive at the bottom of the hill where Whiskeyjack was killed, just after Itkovian was struck “with palpable force, a flood of raw pain, of immeasurable loss.” While Stonny and Gruntle head to the top of the hill, Itkovian moves toward the field where the T’lan Imass formed, feeling “cold horror. His god was gone. His god could not deflect it as it had once done . . . loss and sorrow such as he had never felt before. The truth . . . I am not yet done.” The T’lan Imass turn to face him.</p><p>SCENE 16</p><p>Gruntle, feeling murderous and predatory, watches Orfantal appear from a warren with Brood and sees Stonny staring down at three corpses. Brood kneels to heal Korlat while Silverfox weeps. As he watches, Kruppe suddenly collapses and is caught by Hetan. Gruntle turns to see Itkovian move toward the T’lan Imass. Silverfox screams and begins running and Gruntle thinks he knows what Itkovian is saying to the Imass: “You are in pain. I would embrace you now.” Gruntle “feels his god’s horror, burgeoning to overwhelm his own—as the T’lan Imass made reply. Falling to their knees. Head bowing. Ah, Summoner. And now, it was far too late.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter 25, Part 1</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>In Hood’s temple back at Capustan, Coll watches as K’rul enters the temple and is welcomed by Baudin as The Knight of Death. When K’rul moves toward the Mhybe, Coll steps before him and says if K’rul plans on sacrificing her on the altar he’ll have to go through Coll. Murillio steps beside him in support. Hood, through Baudin, comments to K’rul on mortal “audacity,” which K’rul calls their most “admirable gift.” To which Hood responds, “Until it turns belligerent, perhaps. Then it is best answered by annihilation.” K’rul calls that’s Hood’s answer, implying it is not his own. He tells Coll and Murillio he is there to save the Mhybe, not kill her, and says due to events far to the south, it is time for her to “dream for real.”</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Silverfox is motionless in shock: the T’lan Imass are “gone from her soul” after Itkovian’s embrace, the T’lan Ay have “abandoned” her, Whiskeyjack and her two marines are killed. She looks at the K’Chain Che’Malle and thinks the T’lan Imass will be unable to resist once the Hunters attack, thanks to Itkovian—”you noble fool.” She watches the Grey Swords and Gruntle’s legion prepare to attack, Tayschrenn preparing his warren, the dejected Malazans getting ready, Brood healing Korlat, and thinks it all for naught, as the they will all die at the hands of the Pannions. Despite that, she “had no choice. She would have to begin. Defy the despair, begin all that she had set in motion so long ago.” She disappears into her warren.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>The Mhybe thinks she wasn’t ready to be a mother when it happened, thinks she could have said no to Kruppe, K’rul, the Imass. She believes everyone assumed that the mere fact that Silverfox was born of the flesh from the Mhybe like all other children, the maternal bond would be automatic and thinks they should not have made that assumption, and says Silverfox was not born “innocent,” but was born with purpose, out of pity rather than love. She feels now she is expected to act in this dreamworld, with “ancient gods, bestial spirits, a man imprisoned in pain,” and wonders if she and this man are akin to each other: “The beast waits for me—the man waits for me. We must reach out to each other. To touch, to give proof . . . we are not alone.” Realizing the cage of ribs must be broken from the outside, she begins to crawl toward it, refusing to “forsake” the man, “this brother of mine,” as she believes Silverfox has forsaken her.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Itkovian prepares to embrace the T’lan Imass, who had “twisted all the powers of the Warren of Tellann into a ritual that devoured their souls . . . left them—in the eyes of all others—as little more than husks, animated by a purpose they had set outside themselves, yet were chained to—for eternity.” But Itkovian knows they are not husks at all, and he feels their memories, a series of them (including some whom we’ve seen earlier): death, love, fear/distrust of the ritual, a realization that “there was no justice in this war. We’d left our gods behind, and knelt only before an altar of brutality.” Itkovian takes it all, but it is too much and he begins to fail. But before he does, Pran Chole tells him he can lead Itkovian to a place. Itkovian reaches out and a hand clasps his forearm.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>The Mhybe crawls toward the cage, but then suddenly feels a huge weight, the air suddenly grows hot, and she knows something is happening.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>The hand leads Itkovian “through a mindscape” whose land lies far below him. Pran Chole then tells him to “shed these memories. Free them to soak the earth . . . through you they can return life to a dying, desolate land . . . Memories belong in the soil, in stone, in wind. They are the land’s unseen meaning . . . old, almost shapeless echoes—to which a mortal life adds its own. Feed this dreamscape.”</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>The Mhybe watches clouds form in the sky, then something like rain or hail falls: “Each impact was explosive, something more than simply frozen rain. Lives. Ancient, long forgotten lives. And memories—All raining down. The pain was unbearable.” Kruppe appears and, sheltering her from the rain, begins dragging her forward: “Not much further dear lass. This storm—unexpected . . . yet wonderful. But you must not stop now. Here, Kruppe will help you.”</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Silverfox in her dreamworld thinks how her intent had been to deny the T’lan Imass and Ay only for a “brief time, in which she would work to fashion the world that awaited them. The spirits that she had gathered, spirits who would serve that ancient people, become their gods—she had meant them to bring healing to the T’lan Imass, to their long-bereft souls. A world where her mother was young once more. A dreamworld, gift of K’rul. Gift of the Daru, Kruppe. Gift of love, in answer to all she had taken from her mother.” Now she grieves over all she lost, and the part that was Tattersail “keened with inconsolable grief” over Whiskeyjack, who had stepped in to protect her for all that she had turned away from him. She has lost the Imass, and thinks how she has been defeated by the courage of all around her: Whiskeyjack, Itkovian, Coll, Murillio, Tayschrenn. Then the sky changes and she looks up in disbelief.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>The wolf batters against the cage of ribs and Toc feels the pain but also pain from outside, “a storm blistering the skin covering his ribs—yet it grew no stronger, indeed seemed to fade, as if with each wounding something was imparted to him, a gift . . . lost moments of wonder, of joy, of grief—a storm of memories.” He is suddenly pulled out of the dreamworld and is back to darkness and the sounds of the Matron shrieking and pulling at its chains, trying to reach for him. He can feel/hear the sounds of battle: screams, concussions, yells. Then light arrives and he sees the Matron and the Seer, the latter holding a “lizard’s egg, latticed in grey magic.” As he chants, “something exploded from the Matron’s body, a coruscation of power . . . snared by the web of sorcery . . . then drawn into the egg . . . the Finnest.” The Seer leaves, taking the Matron, and darkness falls again. Toc feels the wolf dying inside of him, trying to get out and failing. Then more sounds, silence, then a hand on his forehead. Tool announces himself “kin to Aral Fayle, to Toc the Younger,” and picks him up.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>Picker’s group has followed Tool to the Keep but not inside, but then are forced into where Hedge’s group breached the Keep by the appearance of a K’Chain behind them. They find Hedge, Bluepearl and more Bridgeburners. Before they can do much of anything, Blend throws Picker forward as the K’Chain arrives faster than expected, forcing Hedge to toss his final cusser right at the ground at his and its feet. The explosion blows Picker and Blend through a doorway. She and the remaining Bridgeburners meet up with Envy, who asks if they’ve seen a T’lan or the Seguleh. After a moment’s confusion, she realizes the Imass they mention was Tool, not Lanas. She tells Picker her group is there to rescue Toc and says if they help her she’ll heal them. Picker agrees and has Envy start with the unconscious Blend. Baaljagg joins them.</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>Paran’s group can’t figure out what is causing all that screaming they hear from below or what is distracting the condors, but they can tell its an enemy to the Pannions so they take advantage of it by heading for a trapdoor leading off the roof (save for Paran and Quick Ben who stay behind).</p><p>SCENE 12</p><p>Dujek’s army had held up well against the first few waves of K’Chain thanks to the munitions, but then they ran out and they began to be slaughtered. His own company has been destroyed. He is found by a soldier sent by Captain Hareb to look for Dujek. She tells him they are killing K’Chain thanks to Twist, who brought in more (the last) munitions and the sappers are using them to drop buildings on top of the Hunters. She starts to lead him to the squad.</p><p>SCENE 13</p><p>The Grey Sword commanders asks if Gruntle will flank them as they attack, and Gruntle says no; his group will lead the attack and hers will follow as they aim for the gate, though they both know their attempt to relieve Dujek will fail. Tayschrenn sends a messenger saying he will deal with the mages on the wall while the Barghast and Andii, led by Orfantal, will help attack the K’Chain. Gruntle looks at his legion and thinks they are “Like D’ivers only in reverse. From many, to one—and such power!” He feels they will transform again for the battle: “his god seemed to possess a particular hatred for these K’Chain Che’Malle, as if Treach had a score to settle. The cold killer was giving way to bloodlust—a realization that left Gruntle vaguely troubled.” He looks up to the hill and sees Korlat rising beside Brood, and senses she is not fully healed, that “Brood’s warren suffers.” He can tell Tayschrenn is paying a price for the magic he will use. His legion forms again into the Tiger and they attack.</p><p>SCENE 14</p><p>Korlat feels Kurald Galain flowing. Brood tells her they don’t have time for the army; she must find Rake and Moon’s Spawn—they need him. He asks if he is in the approaching storm cloud. But Korlat tunes him out, watches as Orfantal veers into dragon form while condors fly out to meet him, Gruntle’s legion attacks and loses people, Tayschrenn uses Telas to attack the Pannion sorcerers, and the Grey Swords come to Gruntle’s aid. Tayschrenn is struck by sorcery and falls to his knees and Brood again begs her to call to Rake. The storm cloud dissipated, revealing no Moon’s Spawn, and she tells Brood “Anomander Rake is no more,” feeling despair within herself and thinking “He is dead. He must be.” As she continues to watch, she sees Orfantal attacked by the condors. She tells Brood “this battle is lost. I fly to save Orfantal” and veers into dragon shape and heads to battle.</p><p>SCENE 15</p><p>Brood watches as the K’Chain wade through Gruntle’s legion, the Grey Swords, the Malazans, the Barghast. Four Malazans appear and lay an unconscious Kruppe on the ground. The T’lan Imass, meanwhile, remain unmoving, kneeling before Itkovian, who is also kneeling. Looking at all the losses, Brood thinks “No choice. Burn, forgive me.” He raises his hammer, but before it falls, he freezes.</p><p>SCENE 16</p><p>Picker’s group, Envy, and Baaljagg move downward. Blend finds tracks: bony ones (Envy assumes Tool or Lanas Tog), but also a woman in moccasins. Envy wonders who might be following the T’lan Imass. The last set of tracks belongs to a man. They hear fighting from above heading toward them, but Baaljagg suddenly takes off farther below and Envy says she must have sensed Toc. As Envy is about to explain the whole Togg/Fanderay thing, the fighting from above arrives via a score of Urdomen.</p><p>SCENE 17</p><p>Detoran, Mallet, Spindle, Antsy, and Trotts, are heading down from the roof and finding lots of dead bodies. They run into enemies above and below. Antsy is badly wounded and Detoran killed. Mallet is wounded by Trott’s sword as he comes falling down the stairs amidst a group of Seerdomin. Trotts kills them despite being badly wounded himself. He and Mallet head down to collect Spindle and Antsy.</p><p>SCENE 18</p><p>Toc is being carried by Tool. He wishes for the Seer to come and free him to “walk through Hood’s Gate.” He can feel the wolf dying. They enter a room and Tool is met by Mok, who waits for Tool to gently put Toc down. Tool asks that when Mok is done with Tool, he takes Toc from here. Mok agrees, then the two begin to fight. As Toc watches, he feels the wolf inside him stir, still trapped in this “cage of bone.” He sees a large beam capped in bronze and slowly drags himself upright.</p><p>SCENE 19</p><p>Kruppe tells the Mhybe “you must touch, lass. This world—it was made for you— . . . a gift—there are things that must be freed.” The Mhybe thinks, “yes, she understood that word. She longed for it, worshipped it . . . freed . . . Like these memories of ice, raining . . . freed to feed the earth—deliverance, of meaning, of emotion, history’s gift—the land underfoot, the layers . . .” She reaches out.</p><p>SCENE 20</p><p>Toc staggers toward the beam, then falls toward its end to let it meet his rib cage. It shatters them.</p><p>SCENE 21</p><p>The Mhybe touches.</p><p>SCENE 22</p><p>The wolf feels the cage broken, feels itself freed, and howls.</p><p>SCENE 23</p><p>The howl freezes Brood, and then another answering cry from the T’lan Ay who rise and attack the K’Chain Che’Malle, destroying many of them. Above, the condors break from the two dragons and head for the keep, followed by Korlat and Orfantal and tens of thousands of Great Ravens.</p><p>SCENE 24</p><p>Kruppe, holding the Mhybe, steps back as the wolf erupts from the shattered cage. The rain of memories stops and he feels “a pressure, a force, ancient and bestial. Growing.”</p><p>SCENE 25</p><p>Sudden gloom and weight falls over the city. Quick Ben identifies it as Kurald Galain and says he can use it to get them over the wall. Paran hears condors screaming in terror. He looks up and sees the Seer thirty paces away, holding the Finnest with the Matron beside him—”mindless, her soul stripped, filled with a pain he [Paran] knew she could not even feel.” Two K’ell Hunter bodyguards move toward a pair of Seguleh that appear. Out in the harbor, from below the water, Moon’s Spawn rises “darkness bleeding from it in radiating waves,” as the Andii perform a full unveiling. As Quick Ben and Paran watch, it continues to rise, spilling massive amounts of water from newly formed fissures, and as it turns, Rake comes into view standing on a ledge.</p><p>SCENE 26</p><p>Itkovian tells the T’lan Imass he will take their pain, now that the memories are done. The T’lan Imass tell him he cannot take it, he is mortal, he cannot carry it nor deliver it, but he says “I shall” and as it rises over then falls toward him, he smiles.</p><p>SCENE 27</p><p>Moon’s Spawn, badly damaged, listing, moves toward the keep as waves of Kurald Galain from dragons incinerates the condors. Brood, watching, “overcome with a vast, soul-numbing helplessness,” thinks: “Kurald Galain spreading out, down, into Coral—A true unveiling . . . the world has never known this—in all the millennia since their arrival—never known this. Burn’s heart, what will come of this unveiling.”</p><p>SCENE 28</p><p>Korlat can tell Moon’s Spawn is dying as it moves toward the parapet where stand the Seer and Matron. She thinks “Darkness comes to this world. To this place, this city. Darkness that would never dissipate. Coral. Black, black Coral.</p><p>SCENE 29</p><p>Envy, taking Picker’s sarcasm as confidence, didn’t help the Bridgeburners at first. Realizing her error, she kills the Urdomen but only three Bridgeburners are left alive by then. Mallet, Spindle, Antsy, and Trotts arrive, but as they do, Trotts dies. Envy says she will help heal the wounded, but before she can begin, Kurald Galain drops down and she tells them they have to head down.</p><p>SCENE 30</p><p>Mok defeats Tool, knocking his sword away, and just as he is about to finish Tool off seemingly, he is thrown against a far wall and knocked unconscious by Kilava in panther from. Tool tells her not to kill him. She cannot believe Tool was beaten by a mortal man and says she will kill him so Tool has no more challengers. Tool tells her “our time—it has passed. WE must relinquish our place in this world. Mok . . . is the Third. The Second and the First are his masters . . .Do you understand me?” He looks to Toc’s corpse, impaled on the beam. Kilava tells him Togg is free and asks if Tool can hear it. He says no. She says, “That howl now fills another realm, the sound of birth. A realm brought into existence by the Summoner. As for what now gives it life . . . something else entire.” Lanas Tog appears, looking for Silverfox. Baaljagg steps into the chamber and mourns at Toc’s corpse. When Tool tells her Togg is free, Kilava says Baaljagg knows and that to find Silverfox, Tool will need to take the path of Togg: “into the Warren of Tellann. Then to a place beyond.” He ask her to come and she refuses, says she has come for the Seer. Toc knows she seeks him “for redemption” and tells her to come to Toc when she is done. He and Lanas fall to dust then vanish. Kilava steps to Baaljagg and says “you grieve for this mortal . . . for him you hold back on what you so long for—your reunion with your lost mate . . . This mortal’s soul—it rides Togg’s own—and your mate would deliver it, but not to Hood’s Gate. Go then, pursue that trail.” She opens a warren for Baaljagg, who disappears into it, then Kilava leaves.</p><p>SCENE 31</p><p>Blend steps out of the shadows where she has been watching from and is followed by the others, Envy complaining of Kilava’s “rudeness” in bowling through them in panther form on her way out. She is saddened then by the sight of Toc’s corpse and decides to head for the Seer “before Kilava robs me of my vengeance.” Picker says they’re heading back for Dujek’s army. Envy storms out.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER 25 PART 2</strong></p><p>SCENE 32</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">As Paran watches the Seguleh slowly win against the K’Chain, Quick Ben points out that Moon’s Spawn is going to crash into the keep. Kilava, still in panther form, appears on the roof and Quick Ben yells at her to wait. Quick Ben calls on Talamandas as Moon’s Spawn strikes the roof, crushing the Matron and heading toward the Seer and just behind him Kilava. Quick Ben hits her with a bolt of sorcery then, telling Paran to follow him, and leaps for the Seer as Paran grabs hold of Quick just before he opens a warren. All plunge into it, followed by Kilava. Moon’s Spawn sinks into the roof, and a huge chunk of Moon falls, killing the two Hunters while the Seguleh make a run for it.</span></p><p>SCENE 33</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">Gruntle is exhausted and is left with only eight of his soldiers alive. Stonny appears, tells him she’s been doing what she could, mentions that the Mott Irregulars are somehow here. Moon’s Spawn has torn through the keep and drifts overhead, rain falling from it. The Grey Swords’ Destriant appears and tells them they found Dujek and 800 of his soldiers. She tells them the city has fallen and they will be gathering outside the walls. Gruntle says they’ll join her, thinking if it weren’t for the Ay they’d all be dead. He wonders what is happening with Itkovian.</span></p><p>SCENE 34</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">Korlat and Orfantal fly toward Moon’s Spawn and as they do, they sight four Malazan ships of war entering the harbor. Orfantal tells her to go down; he’ll stay and guard the skies, though the enemy is fallen. He tells her: “What you would guard, staying with me, is the heart within you. You would fend it from pain. From loss. Sister, he deserves more. Go down, now. To grieve is the gift of the living—a gift so many of our kin have long lost. Do not retreat. Descend, Korlat, to the mortal realm.” She lands and veers back into human form. As she moves toward Brood, she watches Crone report to him then fly away, and she thinks she has “never seen Brood looks so defeated.” High Marshall Stump reports to Brood that the Boll Brothers took care of the mages atop the wall and asks what the Mott Irregulars should do now. He suggests putting out fires and when Brood says fine, he leaves. As Korlat nears, Brood is trying to figure out how the Irregulars got in the city, behind the wall. Korlat tells him of the ships and Brood says Tayschrenn has already informed him, before heading to the ships. When Korlat mentions the Malazans, due to their losses, won’t be “bargaining from a position of strength,” Brood tells her “as far as I’m concerned, the Malazans have earned all they might ask for. If they want it, Coral is theirs.” Korlat informs him the full unveiling of the Warren of Darkness is permanent, that “the city now lies as much within the Tiste Andii warren as within this world.” Brood asks if the Andii will claim Coral, now that it’s obvious Moon’s Spawn is just about finished. She says she doesn’t know what Rake intends and head for the hill where Whiskeyjack lies. As she walks, she thinks: “Dear Mother Dark, do you look down upon me now . . . Do you smile, to see me so broken? I have, after all, repeated your fatal errors of old. Yielding my heart, succumbing to the foolish dream—Light’s dance, you longed for that embrace, didn’t you? And you were betrayed. You left us, Mother, to eternal silence. Yet, Mother Dark, with this unveiling, I feel you close. Was it grief that sent you away, sent you so far from your children? When, in our deadly, young way—our appalling insensitivity—we cursed you. Added another layer to your pain. These steps, you walked them once. How can you help but smile.” She steps into rain falling from Moon’s Spawn “weeping down upon her and upon the filed of corpses surrounding her . . . upon thousands of kneeling T’lan Imass . . . the scene . . . growing more solid, more real. No longer the faded tableau of a Tiste Andii’s regard. Life, drawn short, to sharpen every detail . . . make every moment an ache.” She begins to cry.</span></p><p>SCENE 35</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">Brood watches her cry: “as her head tilted back, face slowly lifting to the shroud of the rain . . . A heart, once of stone, made mortal once more. This image . . . he knew, with bleak certainty, would never leave him.”</span></p><p>SCENE 36</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">Silverfox is approached by the Rhivi spirits. As she awaits them, she thinks everything has been ruined: “there were lives within that frozen rain. Entire lives, sent down to strike the flesh of this world, to seep down, to thaw the soil with its fecundity. But it has nothing to do with me. None of this. All that I sought to fashion—destroyed. This dream world was itself a memory. Ghostworld of Tellann, remembrance of my own world, from long, long ago . . . taken from the Bonecaster who was there at my refashioning, taken from the Rhivi spirits, the First Clan, taken from K’rul, from Kruppe. Taken from the slumbering land itself—Burn’s own flesh. I myself possessed nothing. I simply stole. To fashion a world for my mother . . . where she could be young . . .live out a normal life . . . All that I stole from her, I would give back.” She thinks bitterly that her intent had justified her theft, but it was a lie, and so all she “hoarded was in turn stripped of value . . . gone to dust.” When the spirits arrive, she thinks she knows they wonder what false promises she will offer this time, what lies. Thinks she had a people for them, a people who had lost their own gods. The spirits tell her they have found two thrones, awaiting “this warren’s true masters.” Angered, Silverfox says the realm was made for the Rhivi, and wonders who dares “usurp” their right. But the spirits say she is wrong, that the realm is too much for them, too “vast, too powerful . . . we will endeavour to treat with the new masters. I believe they will allow us to remain. Perhaps indeed we will find ourselves pleased to serve them.” And despite the spirit telling her that her goal might still be achieved, if in different fashion, Silverfox thinks, “As I stole, so it has been stolen from me.” She tells the spirits to go and walks away, thinking “My gift to her. My gift to you. . Grand failures, defeats born from the flaws within me . . . [I am] an abomination.”</span></p><p>SCENE 37</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">The Rhivi elder says they will seek the mother again, as commanded by the Bonecaster. Another says she will simply flee as she did from the Ay and wonders why this would be any different. The first says because “this land . . . now lives.”</span></p><p>SCENE 38</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">Toc is free, “riding the soul of a god. Within the muscles of a fierce, ancient beast.” He howls and is answered by the appearance of the Ay: “the children of Baaljagg—of Fanderay—ghost memories that were the souls of the T’lan Ay. Baaljagg had held them, within herself, within her dreams—in an ageless world into which an Elder God had breathed eternal life” Then Fanderay arrives and the two wolves/gods are united. Toc looks on with joy as they run toward their thrones.</span></p><p>SCENE 39</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">The Mhybe tries to break free of Kruppe’s hold, afraid of the wolves she senses/hears despite Kruppe’s statement that they have nothing to fear. Kruppe tells her the world is no longer his, it must be “passed on . . . You are the vessel in truth, now! Within you—take this dream from me. Allow it to fill your spirit.” She breaks free and finds herself seemingly chased by tens of thousands of wolves led by two huge ones. Before her is a bone hut and a group of Rhivi. The wolves arrive but ignore her. She asks what is happening and Kruppe tells her Togg and Fanderay have come “to claim the Beast Throne.” The Rhivi elder tells her the world was created by Silverfox for the Mhybe: “it is for you. Indeed, it exists within you. With this world, your daughter asks for forgiveness,” and “sought to answer” the tragedy of the Rhivi, the T’lan Imass, the Ay. When the Mhybe asks where Silverfox is, the Rhivi answers that “despair has taken her away.” The Mhybe asks if she will awaken and Kruppe says “That woman [the old Mhybe back in Hood’s temple] now sleeps eternal . . . Your daughter spoke with Hood. Reached an agreement . . . She believes, having lost the T’lan Imass, that she has broken it.” The Mhybe realizes the agreement was freedom for the Imass, “their souls delivered to Hood.” When she says Hood won’t stand for the loss of the T’lan Imass, Kruppe replies that Hood is patient. The Mhybe wishes for Silverfox so the Mhybe can beg forgiveness of her. Togg speaks to her and tells her that Toc is within him, and that the god would release him if she—the “mistress” of the realm, would give leave. She does.</span></p><p>SCENE 40</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">Itkovian, under the rain of Moon’s Spawn, tells the T’lan Imass he has taken their pain and suffering and will leave them. The T’lan Imass say they do not understand why such a gift. He tells them he was born 30 years ago and his mother, attached to a “hard, just man . . . smiled but once in all the years I knew her. The moment when I departed. Still, it is the smile I remember. I think now that my father embraced in order to possess. That she was a prisoner. I think, now, that her smile answered my escape. I took something of her with me. Something worthy of being set free . . . In the Reve, I wonder, did I simply find for myself another prison?” The Imass tell Itkovian his mother is free within him but they still do not understand his compassion and generosity. Itkovian says: “We humans do not understand compassion. In each moment of our lives, we betray it. Aye, we know of its worth, yet in knowing we then attach to it a value, we guard the giving of it, believing it must be earned. T’lan Imass, compassion is priceless . . . It must be given freely. In abundance.” He dies.</span></p><p>SCENE 41</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">Silverfox meets Tool and Lanas and behind them, the Ay. Tool tells her to free the Ay—”Their spirits await them. They would be mortal once more, in this world you have created.” She releases them: “for too long have they known chains. For too long have these creatures known the burden of loyalty.” Tool thanks her, introduces Lanas Togg, then drops his sword at his feet. She wonders at the act, then realizes what it means.</span></p><p>SCENE 42</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">Baudin says it is time to inter the Mhybe. K’rul wonders since when has Hood become so generous and Baudin says he is “ever generous.” Murillio protests she is still alive and K’rul informs him that it is not a burial; she “will sleep for ever more. She sleeps, to dream. And within her dream lives an entire world.” Coll tells Murillio they should help with the bedding for her. The two priests remove their masks and when Coll asks why they are crying, K’rul says their gods have found each other inside the Mhybe’s dream world.</span></p><p>SCENE 43</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">Paran, Quick Ben, and the Seer fall out of the warren. Quick Ben has the Finnest. Kilava bursts out of the warren behind them and Paran swings his sword, wounding her, before she throws him aside. Quick Ben tells her to stop and attacks her with sorcery, then tells Paran to stand because he’s done. The panther growls at him and Paran growls back, taking the form of the hound again. As Kilava hesitates, Quick Ben tells her they are not her enemies; “we seek what you seek.” When she still looks to attack he yells, “vengeance is not enough.” She veers back into Imass form. She identifies the setting—Morn—and Paran turns to see the rent: “A wound, bleeding pain—such pain, an eternity—gods below, there is a soul within it. A child. Trapped. Sealing the wound . . . the child of my dreams.” Quick Ben speaks to the Seer and says the Finnest holds the Matron’s power—”Unable to sense itself, yet alive . . . presumably it feels no pain.” Kilava interrupts and asks what Quick Ben intends and he tells her something where everyone wins. She says she wants vengeance for her brother’s pain over Toc. She relates what happened and says she wants to make the Jaghut suffer. The Seer says haven’t you already? Quick Ben tells them both that the Jaghut’s sister is still inside the rent and that sending the Finnest in will release her. The Seer asks for what purpose: “how long would we survive. . The T’lan Imass will hunt us in earnest . . . I free my sister to what? A short life, filled with flight? I remember . . . running. Never enough sleep. Mother, carrying us . . .” He tells Kilava he remembers her too, sending them into the rent and she says it was a mistake; she thought it was a portal to Omtose Phellack, but he doesn’t believe her. When she protests it was an accident, he asks why she never rectified it and when she says she didn’t find a way he calls her a coward. Quick Ben says enough—free his sister with the Finnest, and Kilava says while the Jaghut is right—they will be hunted and killed—that is still a better fate. He says he’ll just wait for somebody to probe the portal, exchange themselves. Quick Ben says he has a better idea. He tells the Seer he knows that the Imass will seek Omtose Phellack whenever it is unveiled, but he knows of a place they will not be able to find it, where Omtose Phellack can not only survive and thrive but heal. When the Seer calls Quick a liar, Kilava says perhaps he should listen, then Paran points out the Seer has been manipulated by the Chained God, used to wreak havoc and pain, and he asks “since when were the Jaghut interested only in destruction . . . Do you still feel as twisted inside? Do you still delight in thoughts of delivering pain?” The Seer says he feels empty and asks why he’d believe them. Paran tells Quick Ben to let him go – then tells the Seer that if he accepts the offer, he will be safe with his sister and could even make the Chained God pay. When Kilava says the Seer will twist/corrupt his sister, Paran says the Seer will not be alone with her. Quick Ben tells Talamandas to release the Seer, and he rises to his feet, then asks Quick Ben if the place is far.</span></p><p>SCENE 44</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">The sister, the same young age, steps out of the warren. When Kilava asks what she will remember, Quick Ben says hopefully nothing and tells her he and Talamandas will work to ensure that. The Seer stays back and Paran tells him go to her. When he says she remembers a brother, Paran says he can be her uncle. The Seer then says, “We Jaghut are not known for compassion among our blood-tied” and Paran replies “And we humans are? You’re not the only one who finds such things a struggle. There’s much you have to repair, Pannion, starting with what is within yourself, with what you’ve done . . .let the child—your sister—be your guide . . . you need each other.” The Seer tells Paran he regrets what he did to Toc, then tells Kilava she has her own road to redemption. They both agree they cannot forgive the other, yet. He goes to meet his sister.</span></p><p>SCENE 45</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">Inside Burn’s cavern, Paran can see the Crippled God’s infection dissolving the giant. They are joined by the old witch Quick Ben had spoken to about Burn earlier. She tells Pannion she has been chosen by Burn to help him take care of his sister. But that first he must unveil Omtose Phellack and use its cold to fight Burn’s fever/infection. He does so and Quick asks if it’s cold enough for the witch. He tells her it was Picker and the witch’s hints about cold that gave him the idea. The witch tells Kilava the warren is not to be assailed and she cannot tell anyone of its existence. Kilava says this is where she begins her own path toward redemption. Quick Ben tells Paran to think of a card in his mind and lead them out.</span></p><p>SCENE 46</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">Atop the hilltop where Whiskeyjack was killed, Korlat stands over the three Malazan bodies. As Gruntle looks outward, he sees the T’lan Imass are gone, Itkovian’s body lying on the ground as the Grey Swords approach, Brood standing with Taur, Hetan, and Cafal, and Dujek’s devastated army exiting the city. Dujek himself is heading up the hill. A warren opens and out steps Tayschrenn and the Malazans from the ships. One of Gruntle’s survivors asks to raise the Child’s Standard and he tells her to do so down among the dead, in the darkness, and also to stop calling him Lord. She says it was a title and position “purchased in blood” and he relents, but says, “I’m not a soldier. I hate war. I hate killing.” Tayschrenn is introducing the Malazan Ambassador to Brood, who says formal negotiations need to await Rake, due soon. Dujek arrives and looks to Korlat standing over the bodies.</span></p><p>SCENE 47</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.9018627085086343">Toc feels the joy of running, then sudden pain, a rush of breath. He finds himself in Anaster’s body. A Grey Sword asks if he well “leave your gods” and he answers no, and she welcomes him as “Mortal Sword of Togg and Fanderay.”</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER 25 PART 3</strong></p><p>SCENE 48</p><p>Lanas Tog leads Silverfox to the gathered T’lan Imass, now “unburdened.” She asks forgiveness of Pran Chole, who says there is nothing to forgive. She says she will now free them, as she has the Ay, but he tells her no. They have heard from Lanas of their kin trapped on Assail and they must save them first, then they will return to her to have her end them. She says she will join them and he tells her they would be honored. She then asks what Itkovian has done and Pran Chole tells her to sense what he has done, sense the power in the ground. She says the realm is home to the Beast Thrones, the Rhivi spirits, and the Wolf Gods, but he says even more. “You have, perhaps unwittingly, created a realm where the Vow of Tellann unravels. . . Itkovian freed our souls and found, in this realm you created, a place for us.” She asks if they have been “redeemed,” and he tells her only she can do that, “the T’lan Imass have been awakened. Our memories—they live once more, in the earth beneath our feet. And they are what we will return to, the day you release us. We expected nothing but oblivion, upon that release. We could not have imagined that an alternative was possible . . . it surpasses us what one mortal man so willingly embraced.” He tells her they have one more thing they must do before leaving.</p><p>SCENE 49</p><p>Picker watches the Rhivi looking for more bodies. The Bridgeburner corpses had already been retrieved (with the help of the Andii) and she suspects they didn’t find Paran or Quick Ben’s corpses because they weren’t there. She thinks of how the Bridgeburners are destroyed—had been destroyed at Pale. Envy, Garath, and the three Seguleh appear, and then Rake. Rake asks Envy what she wants and when she tells him she’s traveled far to tell him something, he asks what. She says they should go somewhere private and he tells her just say it. She informs him Draconus is plotting to escape Dragnipur and Rake says he wonders what has taken Draconus this long. Envy says “in case you’ve forgotten, we worked damned hard to slay him the first time.” Rake points out she just watched the battle and anyway, there isn’t much Rake can do until Draconus actually frees himself. Envy asks what he knows of the Master of the Deck and when Rake makes it clear he knows a lot, she’s infuriated. She warns him they will try to break the sword and that his “very life totters on the whim of a mortal.” Rake says, “I’d best step carefully then,” and leaves. Picker tells Blend to gather the last Bridgeburners and they’ll head for the gate, where waits the wagon holding their dead. Blends tells Picker she did what she could, but Picker replies “wasn’t good enough, was it?” Blend leaves and as Picker moves away Rake asks if he can join her group on their way to the command position. She says they aren’t very pleasant company but he responds they are “worthy company,” and then tells her he regrets he arrived so late. He says he would pay his respect to a fallen soldier, and she answers they all would. He and the five remaining Bridgeburners head for the hill.</p><p>SCENE 50</p><p>Stonny tells Gruntle she wishes Harllo were there, even just his body with all the other fallen rather than out in the middle of nowhere alone. Brood and Dujek approach Korlat and Dujek asks who saw what happened. Korlat tells him and Dujek asks if the leg was responsible for Whiskeyjack’s death. Korlat lies and says his leg broke after Kallor killed him. Dujek says “We kept telling him to have it properly healed. ‘Later,’ he’d say. Always ‘later.” He asks her again and she lies again and he muses that Whiskeyjack was an excellent swordsman, gave Dassem trouble. He asks how long it took Tayschrenn to recover from Kallor’s attack and the mage said only moments, but too late. Korlat tells Dujek Kallor is “a formidable warrior,” but Dujek still seems troubled by the story. Stonny tells Gruntle the broken leg must have come first and he grabs her and shakes his head. Dujek says, “I have lost a friend.” The simple statement strikes Gruntle hard as he recalls Harllo and Itkovian. Rake arrives with the Bridgeburners and Crone. Dujek’s army—under a thousand—line the slopes of the hill, with the Barghast, Rhivi, Andii, and Brood’s army behind them, silent, mourning, honoring. Mallet steps up and sees immediately that it was the leg and collapses. Rake asks Korlat how she will answer Whiskeyjack’s murder and she tells him she and Orfantal will hunt Kallor down. He tells her to leave him alive for Dragnipur and she agrees. Rake tells the others that Moon’s Spawn is dying and will be sent over the ocean to sink there. He ask that the three Malazans be interred there, along with the other Bridgeburners. Picker agrees.</p><p>SCENE 51</p><p>The Mott Irregulars are packing up their loot when their table glows and out of the “card” underneath step Paran and Quick Ben and Kilava.</p><p>SCENE 52</p><p>Shortly afterward, Quick Ben calls the Bole Brothers the “scariest mages we’ve ever faced,” though he changes it to “warlocks” rather than mages, and says they have a sister “you wouldn’t want to meet, ever.” Kilava had already left them by then. Paran feels numbed by everything: “He was unused to being the hand of redemption . . . . So long ago, outside Pale, I’d felt her [the Jaghut girl], felt this child, trapped in her eternal pain, unable to comprehend what she had done to deserve what was happening to her. She had thought she was going to find her mother . . . and then it had all been torn away. Suddenly alone. Knowing only pain. For thousands of years.” He thinks how Quick Ben and Talamandas had taken her memory of it, with Hood’s help, how the Seer still has issues, and how Quick Ben had told Paran that “I needed to find a way to slow the infection, weaken the poison. I’d warned the Crippled God, you know. Told him I was stepping into his path. We’ve knocked him back, you know.” He thinks with pride of all they’d accomplished, including “we gave a child her life back.” But just then they reach sight of the hill and Quick Ben says, “I don’t like the feel of this.”</p><p>SCENE 53</p><p>The bodies had disappeared into Kurald Galain and Rake himself took care of interring them. As Gruntle looks after Moon’s Spawn, he sees a group of soldiers standing around a bier and pile of stones. He takes Stonny with him and leads her to where the Grey Swords stand around Itkovian’s body on the bier. Gruntle notices that Anaster is no longer empty, and in fact now feels like Gruntle’s “rival.” The Destriant gives a small speech, but before they can lay the body in the shallow grave, a Malazan soldier steps forward, holding Itkovian’s helm, and tells her he would replace it for his helm he had exchanged earlier. She says no, Itkovian would refuse as he was pleased by the soldier’s gift, but if the soldier wishes, he could return it to . . . “She tails off at the sight of all the survivors of Dujek’s Host lining up at the slope, along with the Andii, etc, and then the Imass. The first T’lan Imass steps forward and tells the Destriant each will offer a gift in turn for the gift Itkovian gave them: Together, they shall become his barrow, and it shall be unassailable. If you refuse us in this, we will defy you.” She doesn’t refuse and he lays a shell on Itkovian’s chest. This continues throughout the night and at dawn, the Malazans start, beginning with the soldier placing the helm. At the end, Gruntle looks at the massive barrow and sees Tellann sorcery in it, holding each object in its place. He leaves the torcs there—thinking “Sorry, Treach. Learn to live with the loss. We do.”</p><p>SCENE 54</p><p>Paran and Quick Ben had watched, but not joined. Paran feels too broken by Whiskeyjack’s death as well as by him and Quick Ben arriving too late to take part in the ritual farewell since they had arrived after Whiskeyjack’s body was already gone. As he and Quick Ben watch Moon’s Spawn drift toward the sea, Quick Ben tells him to draw Moon’s Spawn. He does and then takes them through to a chamber at the end of which was a raised dais, a throne pushed aside to make room for three sarcophagi. Along the approach were others, warded by Kurald Galain. Quick Ben identifies who lies in them, including Twist, Hedge, Shank, Toes, Detoran, and Trotts. They reach the dais and Quick says Rake did those spells himself. Quick Ben adds it was the leg that killed Whiskeyjack, that he had Kallor. Paran thinks how Picker and the others are watching Mallet, worried he’ll try to kill himself out of guilt, though “Mallet, he kept pushing you away . . . It wasn’t your fault, Mallet. Soldiers die.” Quick Ben leaves one of his pebbles behind in case he wants to visit, maybe with Kalam. As they prepare to leave, the mage tells Paran the Andii left everything behind in Moon’s Spawn. Paran wonders why, since they’ll settle in Black Coral and the city is empty. Paran opens a portal and Quick Ben steps through. Paran turns for a final farewell: “Whiskeyjack, for all that you have taught me, I thank you. Bridgeburners, I wish I could have done better by you. Especially at the end. At the very least, I could have died with you. It’s probably far too late. But I bless you, one and all.” He leaves and the portal blinks out, but a new glow appears in the chamber, “seeming to dance with the black web on the sarcophagi.”</p><p>SCENE 55</p><p>Gruntle awaits the approach of the necromancer’s carriage. Reese halts the carriage and bangs on the sides. Bauchelain and Broach exit and says, “This is a place I could call home.” Gruntle laughs and says neither the Andii nor the Malazans will tolerate Broach’s activities. Broach agrees but Bauchelain says think of all the corpses, plus the dismembered K’Chain. Broach smiles. Bauchelain asks Gruntle to move out of their path but asks first if he could answer a question. They’ve received a strange note from a Jib Bole and brothers asking if they could visit the necromancers and Bauchelain wants to know if Gruntle knows them and if so, what sort of etiquette advice he’d give with regard to hosting them. Gruntle smiles and tells him to “Wear your best.” Bauchelain thanks him. Gruntle leaves for the temporary camp set up by the Grey Swords near Itkovian’s barrow. Tenescowri are flocking there, having heard of Anaster’s rebirth and hoping for salvation. Gruntle thinks the Tenescowri “too need to be reborn. The stranger within Anaster . . . has much to do.” Gruntle decides he should “take the man’s measure,” assuming Toc/Anaster will be “a better Mortal Sword than I am. Likely smug, sanctimonious.” When they meet, Toc asks him what it means to be a Mortal Sword. Gruntle, surprised, asks, “You don’t know?” Toc says “No. Do you?” and Gruntle laughingly admits “not really.” The two take an immediate liking to one another as they share experience and head off for a drink. Gruntle says he’ll get Stonny and the two part calling each other friend.</p><p>SCENE 56</p><p>Paran watches as Quick Ben speaks to a Trygalle mage and Kruppe. Picker joins him and tells him he shouldn’t have left her in charge, that she messed up. Paran tries to take the blame, saying he abandoned them, but Picker says Quick Ben told them what the two of them did and they were all thankful that at least some kind of victory came out of all this. Paran then tries to buck her up by saying she came out of Coral with survivors and nobody could have bettered that. Dujek appears and says Paran is right. Dujek looks awful, as if he’s aged years, and his single arm trembles. He calls the Bridgeburners (the five beside Paran and Picker) together and tells them there’s a full complement of back pay in one of the Trygalle carriages and the guild will take them to Darujhistan. As far as he and Tayschrenn “know,” and will report, all the Bridgeburners were killed in Coral. Before anyone can speak, he adds that this was Whiskeyjack’s wish for the company and himself. Finally, he says, he’s giving them one more mission—to deliver someone to Baruk, someone who is not well and who, he says, needs “Malazans. Soldiers.” He dismisses them all but Paran and tells Picker to send “High Mage Quick Ben” up. When Picker is startled by the title, Dujek tells her “That bastard can’t hide any longer. Tayschrenn insisted.” Alone with Paran, Dujek informs him Dujek is taking the Host to Seven Cities to support Tavore’s army and invites Paran, who tells him no thanks. Dujek says he’ll add Paran to the casualty list and he can go with the Bridgeburners. When Paran diminishes his soldiering, Dujek tells him he is truly a “noble man”—not by birth but earned, something he calls “damned rare.” Paran disagrees, saying he’s been “humbled, again and again, by those around me.” Dujek sends him off to his “fellow Bridgeburners” and the two say goodbye. As Paran walks, the significance of that—”fellow” Bridgeburners strikes him: “My fellow Bridgeburners he said. Well, the achievement is shortlived, but even so. I made it.”</p><p>SCENE 57</p><p>Toc/Anaster retrieves the beer for his meeting with Gruntle and Stonny. As he prepares to meet them, a stranger (Tool—whom Toc has no memory of) steps forward to him. He looks like a Barghast Toc thinks, “covered in scars—more scars of battle than Toc had ever seen in a single person before. Despite this, there was a comfort there in his face—a gentleman’s face, no more than twenty years of age . . . framed in long black hair devoid of any fetishes or braids. His eyes were a soft brown.” Tool tells him “I only sought to look upon you to see that you were well,” and Toc thinks, “He believes me to be Anaster. A friend of old perhaps—not one of his lieutenants though—I would have remembered this one.” He tells Tool he is well and Tool replies “This pleases me . . . I will go now, brother. Know that I hold you in my memory,” then heads off into the forest. Something about his walk nags at Toc but before he can place it, the Grey Swords Shield Anvil interrupts with a question. Toc tells her not now and heads off to drink with Gruntle and Stonny.</p><p>SCENE 58</p><p>Kilava meets Tool at the edge of the forest and asks if he is done. He says yes and she tells him she’s missed him. He says he’s missed her as well. She notes the absence of his sword and when he asks if she thinks he’ll need one, she tells him “now more than before I would think.” She tells him of a quarry and says she’ll “invest it, of course, to prevent it shattering,” as she did once before, “so very long ago.”</p><p>SCENE 59</p><p>Envy reawakens Mok and tells him his mask has cracked, saying, “I reluctantly admit, none of our facades have survived unfractured.” She adds Rake has banished them from the city and yes, he awakens in the same forest they had spent days in earlier. But, she says, your punitive mission is done, “perhaps satisfactorily, perhaps not,” though the Pannion Domin is done. When she tells them it’s time to head home, Mok replies they will demand an audience with the Seventh (Rake). She tells him it’s futile—Rake won’t see them and the Andii will blast them with sorcery rather than cross swords. She ends by saying she’s decided to escort them home.</p><p>SCENE 60</p><p>On the way north, Hetan and Cafal meet up with Tool and Kilava. Hetan asks the stranger’s name and Tool says Onos Toolan. She says she can tell he hasn’t bedded a woman in a long time and he smiles. She likes his eyes, “my lover’s eyes.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>MEMORIES OF ICE EPILOGUE</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Paran enters the Finnest House (the Azath in Darujhistan) with a pack of gold and tells Raest he’s decided to live there after spending three weeks in an inn. Raest asks what Paran plans to do with the two bodies in the hallway (Vorcan and Rallick Nom) and Paran replies he doesn’t know yet. He tells Raest tonight is the opening of Picker’s new tavern (in partnership with the Bridgeburners) which they’ve made out of K’rul’s old temple/belfry.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>As Paran exits the House, he stumbles over an old hooded figure with useless legs who asks for a coin. Paran gives him some silvers and the beggar tells him he is seeking a treasure buried in the Tahlyn Hills. Paran tells him he’s got enough money, and warns him hanging around outside the House probably isn’t a great idea, that “The House does not welcome strangers.” The beggar says, “Not this House . . . but I know one that does.” Paran leaves.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Picker stares at the man they had brought back to Baruk (Duiker). She thinks how Baruk “had done all he could to restore life to what had been a mostly destroyed, desiccated body.” Duiker hasn’t spoken a word since the resurrection. She looks around the nearly empty bar (only the Bridgeburners, Kruppe, Murillio, and Coll), depressed at the failure of opening night at K’rul Bar. Baruk enters. Picker says the hell with the opening, time for some stories, and she suggests that the Daru might like to hear how Coral was taken. But nobody wants to tell it. Spindle says, “Too close . . . a story to break our hearts all over again! Where’s the value in that?” Duiker answers: “There is value,” but says Spindle was right—it is too soon for the story of Coral. He begins to tell the story of the Chain of Dogs.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Prologue</strong></p><p>The prologue opens on a scene of devastation due to flood, a “drowned world,” with bloated corpses being fed upon by small black crabs. A city lies mostly under water due to the flood, seemingly caused by a “warren’s sundering.” The new sea arose due to a river from another realm—a massive river filled with silt and giant catfish and water-spiders—that had been shunted into this one and left to flow for months. Those that didn’t drown were done in by plague, before the rent closed the night before the book’s opening. Silt had piled up against a huge wall that had held back the waters, due perhaps to sorcery. The wall was set at regular intervals with large iron rings at the top. Trull Sengar is being dragged to the wall by his “captors,” whom he also names brothers and kin, by whom he had stood through “all that had happened, the glorious triumphs, the soul-wrenching losses.” He is chained to the wall, a steel plate lodged in his mouth. Then he is shorn ritually: his hair cut and scalp rubbed with a cream to keep him permanently bald, his forehead scarred by a circle with a slash through it to break the circle. The Shorning represents him being cast out, as if he had never existed at all. His captors speak of how Trull has betrayed one of them in particular, intoning that Trull had told them that the unnamed speaker that was betrayed had “severed your blood from ours . . . served a hidden master . . . betrayed our people.” The one betrayed refutes this accusation by listing his accomplishments: “the southlands are aflame. The enemy’s armies have fled. The enemy now kneels before us and begs to be our slaves. From nothing was forged an empire.” And to continue growing stronger, he tells his brothers they must continue to search and when they “find what must be sought,” they are to deliver it to him. He asks if they understand this requirement as well as the sacrifice he makes for their people and his brothers answer yes, and agree that Trull had not only spoken against their seeming leader but had also defended their enemies, calling them “the Pure Kin and [saying] we should not kill them.” When they agree Trull betrayed their brother, their leader says Trull betrayed them all, and there is a momentary hesitation before they agree to this as well, though Trull hears doubt in their voices. Trull thinks to himself this was clever as the leader now “shares out this crime of yours.” His captors leave and Trull thinks how Nature fights “but one eternal war . . . to understand this was to understand the world. Every world. Nature has but one enemy. And that is imbalance.” He muses how the wall holds back the sea, but only “for now,” for the “flood would not be denied.” He thinks he will drown soon, but not much sooner than his own people, for “his brother had shattered the balance. And Nature shall not abide.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Centuries ago, before the “Seven Gods opened their eyes,” a dog, displaying no wounds or sign of rabies, suddenly turned on people mysteriously, killing two and wounding one. The dog is put down by a group of warriors who stab it to death with spears. The people consider how madness “could remain hidden, buried far beneath the surface. The surviving victim, a baby, is brought down to the “Faces in the Rock”—the “Seven Gods of the Teblor,” where he dies soon after.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Karsa Orlong revels in his grandfather’s tales of raids on Silver Lake, of “farms in flames, children dragged behind horses . . . small ears nailed to every wooden post.” The tales confirm for Karsa his grandfather’s bravery and his father’s cowardice and smallness. This despite his father, Synyg, defending his horses against the other clans’ raiders and doing a good job of training Karsa in the “Fighting Dances” and the use of his bloodsword as well as other weapons, so that Karsa, though young, became the best warrior of his clan. Karsa has sworn he will be more like his grandfather than father and that he will lead his people back to the old ways, beginning by leading his two friends Delum Thord and Bairoth Gild on another raid of Silver Lake like his grandfather did in his youth. He believes that in the decades since his grandfather’s raid, Silver Lake has grown from its previous two farms to perhaps as many as three or four, offering more potential victims. He vows before his gods, particularly Urugal—his own clan’s god—to slaughter the inhabitants of Silver Lake and bring glory and pride back to his people the Teblor. He thinks how Dayliss will offer her blessing to his raid and then take him as husband, now that he is a “warrior in truth,” having arrived at his 80th year.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>After Karsa leaves the glade of the gods, seven figures rise from the ground, some “missing limbs, others stood on splintered, shattered, or mangled legs. One lacked a lower jaw . . . Each of the seven, broken in some way. Imperfect. Flawed.” They reflect on how they had been sentenced to inhabit a sealed cavern for centuries, left behind “as was the custom of their kind. Failure’s sentence was abandonment . . . When failure was honorable their sentiment remains would be placed open to the sky,” but these had failed dishonorably. Their rebirth came about from “breaking a vow and swearing fealty to another.” Their kin, those that had left them in the cavern, had marked the site with carved faces and their ritual of binding had “lingered in this place with a power sufficient to twist the minds of the shamans of the people who had found refuge in these mountains.” The seven’s freedom is so far limited to the glade, but their freedom would soon “break free of its last chains” as “service to the new master promised travel . . . and countless deaths to deliver.” Urual (Urugal to the Teblor) says that Karsa will “suffice.” Sin’balle (Siballe) is more skeptical, saying the Teblor don’t even know their true name, to which Ber’ok says “their ignorance is our greatest weapon.” Urual agrees, saying it is their ignorance of “their legacy” which made it so easy for the seven to “twist” the Teblor’s faith. Sin’balle points out they thought Karsa’s grandfather would “suffice” too but failed. Haran’alle says the seven were too impatient, and too weakened by the “sundering of the Vow.” Thek complains their new master hasn’t given them enough power, but Urual says he “recovers from his ordeals as we do from ours.” Urual says in any case, if Karsa fails they will turn to Dayliss’ unborn child (Bairoth is the father), which maks Emroth complain that it will take another century due to the long lives of the Teblor. Urual thinks of Emroth’s “Soletaken proclivities, and its hunger that had so clearly led to their failure so long ago. He tells Emroth to stay close to Dayliss’ unborn child and she says she is already influencing it, saying “what I make within is neither a girl nor a child.” They all return to the earth as night falls.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Karsa goes home and finds his father Synyg grooming his (Synyg’s) horse Havok. Karsa complains his own horse is not there and they rehash an obviously old argument that Karsa’s horse isn’t ready for the journey. Karsa is surprised when his father says he is giving Karsa Havok. His father then tells him Bairoth and Delum are waiting at the river’s ford, and also that Dayliss blessed Bairoth. Karsa asks if his father will bless him and Synyg says Karsa’s grandfather Pahlk has already done so and Karsa should be satisfied with that. When Karsa presses him, Synyg asks what he should bless: “the Seven Gods who are a lie? The glory that is empty? . . The slaying of children?” He adds that Pahlk his more interested in his own youthful “glory” than in Karsa’s. Karsa rides away to meet his two friends. Bairoth and Karsa spar a bit over Dayliss, then the three head out.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Watching the three depart are twenty-three “silent witnesses,” blood-kin of the three friends who had been sacrificed in the glade to Siballe, who called them her “Found.” They dwelt unseen among the Teblor, though some suspected, such as Synyg, or Synyg’s wife and Karsa’s mother, who was considered a threat by the Found and so dealt with via “extreme measures.” Each of them had been scarred along the left side of the face by Siballe. One of them, watching Karsa and the other two leave, says one only will return.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Synyg is cooking when his father, Pahlk arrives and he offers him dinner. The two clearly do not like each other. Pahlk is surprised that Synyg gave Karsa Havok, and when Synyg says “Havok deserved a final battle, one I knew I would not give him,” Pahlk says “as I thought . . . for your horse but not for your son.” He continues that Karsa is ashamed of Synyg and that is why he came to Pahlk. Synyg mockingly asks for more of Pahlk’s raid stories and Pahlk says Synyg sounds more and more like Karsa’s mother, “that damned woman.” When Pahlk finishes his bowl of food, Synyg throws it into the fire and tells him with Karsa gone, if Pahlk ever comes to his door again he will kill him. He then throws him, literally, out of the house.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Karsa and his friends head off toward other clan’s lands and Karsa thinks how he doesn’t plan to sneak through them but to “carve a bloody path.” When Bairoth says his horse needs to rest, Karsa mocks him. Delum also says his horse needs a rest and Karsa gives in: “Two weighted chains about me, then . . . So be it.” At camp, Delum suggests traveling only at night by lower elevations but Karsa says they’ll travel by day and when Bairoth says Karsa will put them into war, Karsa agrees, saying “we shall gather souls.” Karsa does not like Bairoth’s mocking tone, his seeming unwillingness to follow. Bairoth says Karsa doesn’t get the humor and that he is indeed content to follow Karsa. Bairoth then instructs Karsa in politics, how the elders who did not bless this journey will claim they did when the three return, how the facts will be rewritten and the villagers will all “remember” lining the street to see the three off. As they sleep, Karsa wonders if Bairoth’s clever mind and mouth will help him in actual battle.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>They comes across a group of nine Rathyd, another Teblor clan. Karsa plans an attack though his friends are skeptical of the odds. Karsa leads and kills or fatally wounds all but a single “youth” (forty years old). Bairoth and Delum arrive behind him and begin to cut the limbs off one of the Rathyd that Karsa had sliced a leg off of. The youth runs away. When Bairoth complains about Karsa letting the youth escape, Karsa says he did so on purpose to trick the Rathyd into looking for three warriors on foot (they had hid their horses before attacking). Delum then complains that the youth will grow up recalling the horror of this night and will lead his people, becoming “an enemy for the Uryd, an enemy to pale all we have known in the past.” Karsa tells them that “one day . . . that Rathyd warrior shall kneel before me. This I vow, here, on the blood of his kin.” Bairoth says it is the impossible, for “no Rathyd kneels before an Uryd.” Karsa replies it will happen, and they can “witness” his vows becoming truth. They take trophies (ears, tongue, a bear fur and skull) and then prepare to ride out.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>They continue on, killing a few more Rathyd and taking their horses. Karsa’s wounds from the first attack are already healing, a common ability of the Teblor. Karsa tells his friends they will attack the Rathyd village while their warriors are out hunting for them. He will then lead the avenging Rathyd toward the neighboring clan’s lands and start a war between the Rathyd and the Sunyd.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>The three find the village filled only with elders, women, and youth. They attack and kill many and then round up the women. Two “eager” ones go off with Bairoth and Delum. The chief’s wife mocks Karsa’s belief his clan’s women would act differently. Karsa names himself and his lineage, and when he talks of how her people must curse his grandfather, she laughs and tells him Pahlk “bowed his head to beg passage.” She asks how many women they will mate with and he tells them all of them, since they are young and have blood-oil. She says the blood-oil will indeed keep them stimulated enough, will last for days, but that for the women the effect will “haunt” them for months. When Karsa’s turn arrives and the chief’s wife offers her daughter, Karsa takes the wife instead, though she says her husband will curse him for it.</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>Karsa takes the chief’s daughter last. He tells her their village is done and the women should go live with his clan, and that she and her mother should go to his own village to raise his children and wait for him. She asks if she wants to know his name and unaware of how it shames her, tells her no, he’ll just call her Dayliss. He impregnates both her and her mother.</p><p>SCENE 12</p><p>After riding onward from the village, they come across a pack of Rathyd dogs. Karsa grabs and dominates the pack’s leader, Delum kills one dog that doesn’t submit, and they now have control of the pack. Delum tells Karsa he now believes Karsa will do all he says and Karsa tells him he will not be content to lead just their clan but all their people, who have “slept for far too long” and whom he will lead against the outlands.</p><p>SCENE 13</p><p>They start to cross a walkway above untrustworthy, sodden ground and Karsa tell them that sixty years ago, when his grandfather had met with the other Elders, “the river of ice filling the Fissure [a geographic feature to the north of the Teblor valleys] had died suddenly and begun to melt.” When Bairoth says the elders never said what they found up there, Karsa says Pahlk had told him of “beasts that had been frozen in the ice for numberless centuries . . . The river had a black heart . . . but whatever lay within that heart was either gone or destroyed. Even so, there were signs of an ancient battle . . . weapons of stone.” They are interrupted by the appearance of Rathyd warriors behind and before them on the walkway. They kill all but a few who run away. When Karsa tells Bairoth that it was his (Bairoth’s) act that led to victory, Bairoth is surprised and tells him “I am content to follow you, Warleader.” To which Karsa replies in his mind, “you ever were . . . and that is the difference between us.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Two</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>The Rathyd warriors have pulled back the hunt, planning on attacking the three when they return back through their lands. They decide to avoid the other Rathyd villages until the very last one, so as to draw hunters into the Sunyd lands and spark a conflict. They continue on the ride, with Karsa showing surprising concern for a dog wounded in the last fight (now three-legged) and the lead pack dog he had dominated and then named Gnaw. They find a cave along what Phalk had called Bone Pass. Inside strange glyphs cover the back wall—Teblor language but strangely “ornate.” Karsa begins to read the inscription: I led the families that survived . . . Through the [ice] . . . We were so few. Our blood was cloudy and would grow cloudier still. I saw the need to shatter what remained. For the T’lan Imass were still close . . . and inclined to continue their indiscriminate slaughter . . . I fashioned new families and . . . proclaimed the Laws of Isolation, as given us by Icarium whom we had once sheltered and whose heart grew vast with grief upon seeing what had become of us.” When Delum says the words disturb him, Karsa calls them the mad ravings of an elder. He continues to read: “To survive, we must forget. So Icarium told us . . . We must forget our history and seek only our most ancient of legends . . . when we lived simply. In the forests. Hunting . . .When our laws were those of the raider . . . murders and rapes. We must return to those terrible times. To isolate our streams of blood, to weave new, smaller nets of kinship. New threads must be born of rape, for only with violence would they remain rare occurrences, and random.” When he recognizes the names of the clans listed, Karsa refuses to read farther and commands that they sleep outside the cave.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Two nights later, they are at the edge of Sunyd lands, but they haven’t been able to lure Rathyd warriors with them and in fact found the last few villages abandoned. It appears the Sunyd lands are also abandoned, the people flown, but not from Karsa and his friends since the running away seemed to take place long ago. They plan to attack Silver Lake the next day. As they camp for the night, they discuss the cave writing and Bairoth says he believes there is truth amid the ravings and that the language is from a time when the Teblor language was more sophisticated. Karsa says the idea that the Teblor are a “fallen people” is nothing new, that there are tales of past glory. But the other two argue those tales are tales “of instruction, a code of behavior, the proper way of being a Teblor,” and that the cave writings explained why. Delum points out all the children given to the Faces in the Rock due to birth defects caused by inbreeding. Karsa says they are missing the point—if they were defeated, had fallen the job is to rise once more. Bairoth wonders if the Sunyd lands are empty because the Teblor have been defeated yet again. When Karsa argues they can change that, Bairoth says he prays that Karsa’s mind “ever remains free of doubt.” When Karsa takes that as Bairoth saying Karsa is as weak as his father, Bairoth tells him Synyg is not weak, and if anything should be doubted it should be Pahlk’s stories. He sees potential in Karsa to become his father’s son and says he lied when he said he prayed Karsa never faced doubt, that in fact he prays that doubt “tempers [him] with wisdom. Those heroes in our legends . . . they were terrible, they were monsters, for they were strangers to uncertainty.” Karsa challenges Bairoth, but Bairoth refuses to fight and when Karsa demands an apology, Bairoth does so.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>In the village they realize that lowlanders had attacked the Sunyd village. Karsa says their mission now changes from a raid by Uryd to vengeance as Teblor. As they move toward Silver Lake, they come across a huge flat slab of stone with a blue-green hand with a strange number of joints sticking out from under it. It moves when Karsa nears it. He calls it a “demon pinned for eternity beneath that stone,” and Delum names it Forkassal, from their legends—the One Who Sought Peace. They rehash the old tales of the Spirit Wars, invasions involving foreign gods and demons who battled in the mountains until only one group remained. Icarium was in those stories and Delum wonders if the T’lan Imass mentioned in the cave were the victors in that war, and it was that war that shattered the Teblor. Bairoth says they should free the demon. He recalls how the legends say the Forkassal tried to make peace between the opposed forces and it was destroyed. Then Icarium tried, but came too late, but the victors didn’t even try to fight him, knowing how futile it would be. He points out that the cave inscription said it had been Icarium who gave the Teblor the Laws that let them survive and that the Imass would have pinned him under a stone as well if they could have. Delum worries the demon may have gone mad, and that the Imass only pinned it because they could not kill it, meaning it could easily handle the three Teblor. They lift the slab and free the creature. When Bairoth goes to help her rise, Karsa tells him she has known such pressure from the slab she will not wish to to be touched most likely, an insight which surprises Bairoth. Delum goes to get water and Karsa notices that when she looks up, her smile “mocks her own sorry condition. This, her first emotion upon being freed. Embarrassment, yet finding the humour within it.” This response makes him vow that the T’lan Imass who imprisoned her (or their descendants) shall be his enemy. Delum returns but before he can offer the water, she suddenly attacks, knocking Karsa down and throwing Delum hard to the ground. She stands above Karsa and tells him “They will not leave you, will they? These once enemies of mine. It seems shattering their bones was not enough . . . Your kind deserves better . . . I must needs wait . . . and see what becomes of you.” When Bairoth calls her Forkassal, she tells him “you have fallen far , to so twist the name of my kind, not to mention your own. I am Forkrul Assail . . . I am named Calm.” When he wonders how she could attack them after they freed her, she says “Icarium and those damned T’lan Imass will not be pleased that you undid their work . . . but I do know gratitude and so I give you this. The one named Karsa has been chosen. If I was to tell you even the little that I sense of his ultimate purpose, you would seek to kill him. But I tell you there would be no value in that, for the ones using him will simply select another . . . Watch this friend of yours. Guard him. There will come a time when he stands poised to change the world. And when that time comes, I shall be there. For I bring peace. When that moment arrives, cease guarding him. Step back, as you have done now.” She leaves. Delum’s skull is cracked and is leaking brain fluid. Bairoth regrets his advice to free her and is shamed he did not try to fight. Karsa tells him at least one of them is healthy. They bandage Delum though they know he will not regain his thoughts. They return to camp.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Delum moves happily among the dogs, but seems not to even see Karsa or Bairoth. Bairoth is clearly feeling guilty, but Karsa “had little understanding of such feelings, this need to self-inflict some sort of punishment. The error had belonged to Delum . . . The Faces in the Rock held no pity for foolish warriors, so why should Karsa Orlong? Bairoth Gild was indulging himself, making regret and pity and castigation into sweet nectars.” When Bairoth appears with game, Delum acts like a dog in taking a piece and baring his teeth at the “other” dogs. Bairoth says Delum would have been better killed and when Karsa tells Bairoth to kill him then, Bairoth says he will no longer follow Karsa. Karsa calls him weak and foolish and says if he wishes to survive, he needs to follow Karsa. Bairoth tells him how Bairoth and Dayliss had been lovers for a long time and had laughed at Karsa’s strutting. He believes only Karsa will return to their village and when he does so he will wed Dayliss, but, he tells Karsa, in that case it will be Karsa who followed, not Bairoth. When Karsa says he will instead denounce Dayliss for sleeping with a man not her husband and will claim her as his slave, Bairoth attacks him, but before he can do much damage the dogs attack him. Karsa calls them off. They’re interrupted by torchlight coming closer. They see lowlanders come to where the Forkrul Assail had been imprisoned. Karsa attacks and kills the soldiers then, to the shock of the four mages in the group, he walks through their sorcerous fire attack and kills them as well, though one guard manages to escape. Bairoth agrees to follow Karsa in this war.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>They trail the escaped guard and come across two dogs he had killed with crossbow bolts. Karsa decides to go by him and beat him to Silver Lake. They move on and come to a notch in the mountains with water pouring through cracks in the rock. Karsa realizes the scene makes no natural sense and Bairoth agrees, saying the notch wasn’t carved by the river but looks as if some god had “broken a mountain in half . . . It has the look of having been cut by a giant axe.” They find a staircase of bones leading down, confirming at least part of Pahlk’s tale. The stairs were made by “an army had been slain, their bones then laid out, intricately fashioned into these grim steps” and based on the length and depth, Bairoth estimates tens of tens of thousands had been killed. They descend and make camp in a place which according to Pahlk’s description should be only a few days from Silver Lake.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>They grow very close and make camp for the night. Bairoth wonders what the lowlanders had been doing at Calm’s imprisonment site and Karsa says maybe they were going to free her. Bairoth says he thinks they came to worship, that maybe Calm was their god, and maybe her soul could be drawn out like the Faces in the Rock. Karsa tells him “that demon was not a god. It was a prisoner of the stone. The Faces in the Rock are true gods. There is no comparison.” Bairoth replies he wasn’t making one, pointing out “The lowlanders are foolish creatures, whilst the Teblor are not. The lowlanders are children and are susceptible to self-deception.” When Karsa wonders why Bairoth is harping on the issue, Bairoth says “I believe the bones of Bone Pass belong to the people who imprisoned the demon . . . it may be the lowlanders are kin to that ancient people.” Karsa says he doesn’t care; tomorrow they will slay the lowlanders.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>In the morning, Bairoth paints Delum’s face in the manner that warriors do who know they ride to their own deaths, usually aged warriors. Karsa complains Bairoth is dishonoring all Teblor who have worn the battle-mask, but Bairoth answers “Do I? Those warriors grown old, setting out for a final fight—there is nothign of glory in their deed . . . in their battle-mask . . . They come to the ends of their lives and have found that those lives were without meaning. It is that knowledge that drives them . . . to seek a quick death.” He asks Karsa what he sees in Delum’s eyes and when Karsa says “nothing,” Bairoth says “Delum sees the same, Warleader. He stares at nothing. Unlike you, however, he does not turn away from it. Instead, he sees with complete comprehension. Sees and is terrified . . . We can offer Delum no comfort . . . he will die this day Karsa Orlong, and perhaps that will be comfort enough.” As they prepare, Karsa goes over the description of the farmstead Pahlk gave him. Bairoth wonders how many lowlander generations have passed and Karsa dismisses the question with “enough.” They charge around a pinnacle of rock and where they had expected to see a single farm or perhaps a few, stands a walled town with a gate and towers, stone buildings and piers, and a lot more lowlanders than planned on. An alarm bell begins to ring as Karsa and Bairoth charge, killing a few lowlanders on the way to the town. Havok leaps the wall (about the height of a man), separating Karsa from Bairoth momentarily before he rides in through the gate that Karsa breaks down by hand. The two, along with the dogs and even Delum (who attacks like a dog) wreak slaughter throughout the town. As they ride and fight, they come across a pile of “bleached bones, from which poles rose, skulls fixed to their tops. Teblor skulls.” Bairoth’s horse is killed, then Havok is as well, and the two are separated. Karsa sees Delum killed. He kills Delum’s slayer, then rescues a badly wounded Gnaw and leaves him in a barn, before making his way to a raised platform in a warehouse. He jumps down to kill a lowlander, but his impact collapses the floor and falls into the cellar and is impaled above the shoulder blade by a spike of wood (he has already been “festooned with arrows and quarrels). A lowlander (turns out to be the guard who had earlier escaped at Calm’s site) speaks to him and when Karsa names himself and mentions Pahlk, the lowlander asks “the Uryd who visited centuries ago?” Karsa says yes, “to slay scores of children.” But the man says that Pahlk killed nobody, “not at first. He came down from the pass half starved and fevered” and after farmers nursed him back to health, he killed them and fled. The lowlander says they know all about the Uryd from the Sunyd slaves, and that while they haven’t reached Karsa’s tribe yet, they will, and “within a century there will be no more Teblor in . . . Laederon Plateau [save those] branded and in chains.” Karsa is bound and brought up, where he is surrounded by cursing lowlanders. When he smiles at them, the lowlander wonder is Karsa “is the one the priests spoke of. The one who stalked their dreams like Hood’s own Knight?” A new lowlander arrives—Master Silgar—and after speaking to him the lowlander guard says Silgar has “prepared for you a lesson of sorts.” They drag Karsa out to see Bairoth, badly wounded and tied to a spoked wheel. The guard tells Karsa Bairoth refuses to give up any details of the Uryd and Karsa says he will tell them as it won’t matter. The guard draws his sword then and just before he kills Bairoth, Bairoth yells out “Lead me, Warleader.” The guard tells Karsa after he talks Silgar will add him to his slaves. A soldier appears then and the guard tells Karsa it is a Malazan captain, and it was bad luck for Karsa that his attack was while a Malazan company was staying in Silver Lake on their way to Bettrys.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>After Karsa tells them of the Uryd, he is brought to a slave pit in a warehouse and chained to a tree trunk. He concentrates on forcing a remaining arrowhead out of his shoulder. Once he does so, he wonders about Bairoth’s last moments. He didn’t understand why he had refused to speak, as the lowlanders wouldn’t be able to defeat the Uryd no matter what they learned. And he wondered why Bairoth’s last words had sounded like a curse, why Bairoth had abandoned him. He worries his tribe will not follow him when he declares war against the lowlanders but then thinks they will have no choice once the lowlander armies arrive. He finds the arrowhead he forced out of his body and starts using it to chip away at the log where his chains connected. He manages to weaken the shackles somewhat and while he rests, the guard enters to check on him. He tells Karsa Silgar seems to have been right that it will take time to break Karsa’s spirit, but he adds that it will happen eventually. Karsa asks his name and the guard answers he is Damisk, “once a tracker in the Greydog army during the Malazan conquest.” Karsa then asks if it was a conquest, then whose spirit has been broken, and then points out that Damisk ran away in their earlier meeting, and now taunts Karsa only because he is chained. When Damisk leaves, a slave speaks to Karsa and asks if he will succeed at whatever he is attempting with the tree and chains. He says he was part of a group that refused to accept the Malazan conquest and fought from the forests until they were caught. He tells Karsa to spin the log to shorten their chains. He then says it will drag him and his fellows under so they will drown and when Karsa asks if he means for Karsa to kill him, the slave says “More souls to crowd your shadow.” But he then points out by spinning the log he will get water into the shaft and soften things and weaken them more. Karsa spins the log and eventually, to his surprise, the slave appears. He introduces himself as Torvald Nom and the two agree the Malazans are their shared enemy. He says he’s a Daru and just as he is about to launch into a long-winded bio, Karsa says it’s time to turn the log again.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Karsa continues to work on the chains and log. Torvald tells him they have some time as Silgar will wait to travel with the Malazans to protect him from bandits (whom Nom says he helped organize). Karsa says he will kill Silgar. They are interrupted by the return of some Sunyd slaves. Karsa is disgusted with them, with their letting themselves be defeated, enslaved. One tells him they lost the old ways “long ago. Our own children slipping away in the night to wander south into the lowland, eager for the cursed lowland coins—the bits of metal around which life itself seems to revolve . . . some even returned to our valleys as scouts for the hunters . . . To be betrayed by our own children, this is what broke the Sunyd.” When Karsa says they should have killed those children, and that he will do it for them, another Sunyd calls his words empty and points out Karsa is a slave just like them. Karsa straddles the log and pulls on his chains and splits the log, freeing himself. He moves to kill the one who mocked him—Ganal—but Torvald warns him it will raise a cry and Ganal says if Karsa spares him they will stay quiet so he can make good his escape. Karsa frees Torvald for the courage he has shown. They escape the pit, with Karsa killing three guards. When Torvald suggest a direction to run, Karsa tells him he has no plans to flee, but he will avenge his friends and in so doing will create enough of a distraction for Nom to escape easily. Torvald leaves and Karsa finds a shack, kills the person in it, and looks for a weapon, coming across as he does so “a low altar . . . Some lowlander god, signified by a small clay statue—a boar, standing on its hind legs. The Teblor knocked it to the earthen floor, then shattered it with a single stomp of his heel.” He kills a few more and searches more huts before finding a Sunyd bloodsword, some Teblor armor made of bloodwood, and some blood-oil. He enters a house, kills most in it, then rapes a young girl he finds upstairs. He moves on house to house killing more, losing his awareness. When he comes back to full thought, he watches the Malazans ride out through the gate. He hears slavers enter the house below him and discuss how they think Karsa is heading for T’lan Pass where the Malazans will get him. He exits when they leave and makes his way across to the Malazan barracks where he is captured by a Malazan squad including Sergeant Cord, Limp, Shard, and Ebron—a mage who uses a sorcerous net. When Cord asks if it causes Karsa pain, Ebron says if it were Cord in it he’d be screaming and then dead, but Cord notes how Karsa isn’t even trembling. Silgar arrives and thanks Cord for capturing his “property,” but Cord says Karsa is now a Malazan prisoner, and also tells him “The Fist’s position on your slaving activities is well enough known. This is occupied territory—this is part of the Malazan Empire now . . . and we ain’t at war with these so-called Teblor.” He says Karsa will probably be sentenced to the otataral mines, in Cord’s homeland, which he says is rumored to be heading toward rebellion, though he doesn’t buy it. Silgar points out the Malazan hold “on this continent is more than precarious at the moment, now that your principal army is bogged down outside the walls of Pale . . . To so flout out local customs.” Cord interrupts, disgusted: “The Nathii custom has been to run and hide when the Teblor raid. Your studious, deliberate corruption of the Sunyd is unique, Silgar. Your destruction of that tribe was a business venture . . . The only flouting going on here is yours with Malazan law . . . What in Hood’s name do you think our company’s doing here, you perfumed piece of scum.” Tension rises and Ebron tells Silgar, whom he names as a Mael priest, to release his warren and Cord warns Silgar to call off his men or he’ll arrest him and send him to the mines with Karsa. Silgar send his men out then tries to bribe Cord. They are interrupted by the return of the other Malazans led by Captain Kindly, who arrests Silgar for bribery, and says to put him in a cell away from the bandit leader they just captured (Torvald). Kindly then asks what sort of spell Ebron is using on Karsa and Ebron says it’s used to “snare and stun dhenrabi” which stuns Kindly as he realizes how strong Karsa must be, and/or how resistant to magic. He tells them to leave Karsa enspelled and figure out how to load him on a wagon. Karsa can already feel the spell net weakening around him.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Three</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Three days later Karsa is lowered onto a wagon next to the recaptured Torvald Nom. Next to them are Silgar, Damisk, and three other Nathii prisoners. Shard notices that the spell net on Karsa is weaker and Ebron orders him to get lots of heavy chains. He wonders if Karsa has Otataral in his blood. As soldiers arrive with chains, Karsa begins to break free but is knocked out from behind. He wakes up six days later wrapped in chains still on the wagon. Torvald explains a bit of their likely journey to the mines, then tells a story of how in Darujhistan once a group arrived with a grey bear chained up and charged money to see it, but the bear broke its chains and escaped into the hills. He says Karsa has the same look of “Chains will not hold me.” Karsa tells him unlike the bear he will not hide in the hills. Karsa thinks how the world is not what he had expected: the lowlanders weak individually martially but strong in other ways as evidenced by their buildings, towns, ships; Teblor enslaved, lowlander soldiers who stood and fought rather than ran; Malazans as conquerors wholly different in kind seemingly from the Nathii. He sees there must be a flaw or poison within the Teblor themselves to allow them to be so corrupted, and recognizes that Pahlk’s stories were just that, but that his greatest crime was his inability or refusal to wrest free of the Tebrlor’s ways and customs, unlike, Karsa has finally understood, his father, whom he now realizes was not weak, though he faults him for not doing more to challenge his people. He vows to free his people not only from the lowlanders but themselves; he will “shatter their rules . . . unite the Teblor and . . . march . . . . into the lowlands. He decides to feign brain damage to lull the Malazans into false confidence, then falls back into unconsciousness.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>He awakens to a lot of excitement and Torvald tells him the Malazans have just received news that Pale has fallen and Moon’s Spawn retreated and while the soldiers are happy at the news, they’re also upset they weren’t there for it. When Nom asks Shard why, Shard tells him “she don’t trust us . . . We’re Seven Cities and the bitch don’t trust us.” Torvald then asks if that were true, why would she send them to Seven Cities which might rebel rather than keep them on Genabackis? Shard says he won’t say any more; for all he knows Torvald is a Claw. Torvald says if so, he’ll make sure to mention his poor treatment and Shard’s attitude toward the Empress in his “report.” Shard leaves and Karsa tells Torvald of his plan. Torvald agrees to help on condition that Karsa frees him when he manages to escape, and then adds a codicil that Karsa “shall not kill [him] unless given cause.” Torvald asks him to delineate the causes and as he talks on Karsa says he’s decided Darujhistan will be the first city he will conquer. Cord arrives and Karsa feigns unconsciousness while Torvald says all Karsa’s done is drool and grunt. Cord says Torvald doesn’t look like a Claw and the soldiers will continue to treat him like a bandit unless Torvald proves them in error; otherwise Torvald will end up in the mines. Torvald asks what if his mission as a Claw is to assume the disguise of a prisoner in the mines? Cord leaves cursing and Karsa tells Torvald he is playing a deadly game. They start to get loaded onto a ferry.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>They spend weeks traveling, with Karsa tormented by lying down chained for so long. Torvald saves him during this time, feeding him, talking to him to give him an anchor to hold to instead of really going mad. They are transferred to a ship and the guardianship of another group of soldiers. Karsa continues to weaken and starts to lose hold mentally, drifting in and out. They pull into the city of Malyntaeas and Torvald explains how the Nathii, Genabarii, and Korhivi were so busy fighting amongst themselves they didn’t even notice the Malazans arrive in the form of Dujek, the Bridgeburners, three legions, and two High Mages—all of them needed to sink the Nathii fleet attacking Malyntaeas, kill the Genabari royal family, and force the surrender of the Korhivi fortress. Torvald says it was enforced peace, but now the city’s Fist is losing soldiers and he says this is a lesson in “what happens when your tribe gets too big . . . the simplest things become ungainly, unmanageable. Confusion seeps in like fog and everyone gropes blind and dumb.” The First Mate mocks Torvald’s pontificating and Torvald says he’s seems tense—anything wrong in Malyntaeas? The Mate notes that Torvald is the one who might be a Claw, so he tells him the Crimson Guard are in the city stirring up the Korhivi and with the loss of Malazan soldiers things are going to get bad. Torvald points out the Empress would be “remiss to discount the opinions of her officers.”</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Days pass and they are transferred to a huge ocean-going vessel. The new crew is scared of Karsa and when Torvald starts to play on those fears, the captain knocks him down and tells him if he or Karsa gives any trouble he’ll chain them both and toss them overboard. He then tells Karsa to quit smiling or else and Torvald interrupts to say Karsa can’t understand him due to brain damage. The captain orders Karsa gagged.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Karsa speaks to Urugal standing before the other Faces and tells him he has failed them. Urugal says, “Yes. You have abandoned us and so in turn we must abandon you. We must seek another of greater strength. One who does not accept surrender.” Then Karsa finds himself atop a hill of bones with hundreds of chains falling from his wrists down the hillsides. At the end of each chain is a corpse (many decapitated) with the chains running into their chest. They begin climbing toward him chanting, “Lead us Warleader.” He wakes on the ship to a voice saying, “Perhaps we will not abandon you yet. Breathe, Karsa Orlong. Unless, of course, you wish to once more meet your dead.” Torvald has climbed up the chains to try and remove the gag, which has been nearly suffocating Karsa. Karsa looks up into the sky and sees flashing colors “bleeding out from what seemed huge, open wounds . . . Then he notices “the chains, snapping down through the clouds . . . hundreds of chains, impossibly huge, black.” Torvald gives Karsa some water and tells him he’s been lost for weeks and weeks, keeping barely any food down so that he’s down to bones. They’ve been becalmed for days until Karsa began screaming and now the sailors think he’s called this strange storm. The captain arrives and when Torvald tells him Karsa may not even be responsible for the storm, the captain decides to toss him overboard (still chained to the platform), though Torvald says he’ll drown. Suddenly, “from overhead, chains snapped down, massive, plunging, reaching directly for—it seemed—Karsa’s own chest.” The ship is wrecked and Karsa falls into the water. He sees the ship destroyed and a “virulent, massive wound” in the sky, then goes unconscious. He wakes to Torvald crawling onto the platform, after having collected water, a box he hopes is food, and Karsa’s sword and armor from the wreckage. He believes Karsa had called the storm and when Karsa denies it, Torvald tells him those chains of lightning, Karsa—not one missed its target. Not a single Malazan was left standing.” He says Silgar and his men escaped in the dory, and he overheard Silgar talking about how they’d entered a warren—they’re no longer in the ocean. When they open the box of supposed food, they discover Moranth munitions instead.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>They drift timelessly while Torvald works on freeing Karsa. They come across a group of ships and Torvald says it “looks like there was a battle. With plenty of sorcery being flung back and forth.” There are two groups of ships, some “low and sleek . . . cedar . . . single-masted, square sailed . . . The remaining ships were larger, high-decked and three-masted . . . fashioned from wood that was true black—not stained.” Torvald slips into the water and realizes he can stand. Bodies swirl around him as he drags them over to the ships. Torvald climbs aboard one of the ships and ties the platform to try and stop it from sinking while he explores. Karsa speaks to Urugal again, who criticizes him. Karsa says he’s no longer as sure as he once was of his gods, and asks about the strange word Urugal used: bhederin. He wakes to find Torvald climbing down with tools to free him, then goes in and out of consciousness. He wakes again with Torvald gone. He looks at the smaller ships and notes that the prow of one is carved with scenes of battle: “the figures were long-limbed, standing on versions of ships closely resembling the raiders . . . yet the enemy . . . were not it seemed the one’s the ship’s owners had faced here, for the craft . . . were smaller and lower . . . The warriors looked much like Teblor, thick-limbed, heavily muscled.” He sees a number of spiked, black shapes in the water—huge catfish feeding on the bodies. The catfish begin to attack the platform and Karsa barely is able to climb to safety aboard the ship. Torvald harpoons one of the fish and it pulls them into a collision with one of the large ships. Water starts pouring in and Karsa finds his bloodsword and kills the catfish, though he falls unconscious again. He wakes and Torvald tells him he’s found a dory and food and water. He wonders if Karsa’s gods have a warren and Karsa replies he’s never heard the word—the Seven “dwell in the rock and in the dreamworld of the Teblor.” Torvald asks if this looks like it, if it had been flooded. Karsa answers no, that according to the shamans the dreamworld is a “place of no hills, where mosses and lichens cling to half-buried boulders, where snow makes low dunes . . . brown-haired beasts run in packs,” though he adds that the place he himself had visited was different, was a land of “colored mists.” Torvald says he’s trying to figure out where they are and Karsa says it doesn’t matter; they prepare to leave the ship.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>They’ve been rowing the dory for days, with Karsa strengthening but Torvald weakening and growing sick. Finally, they near land—a beach with a large wall running the coastline. A ship similar to the larger ones from the battle scene heads for them. Torvald looks at all the wreckage washing ashore and says it is as he suspected—”this sea doesn’t belong here,” adding nor do the ships. The large ship pulls alongside and Karsa and Torvald climb aboard to find a group of grey-skinned warriors and a pile of severed heads—”most similar to the grey-skinned warriors, though with skins of black.” The eyes on the heads turn to look at Karsa. The warriors demand Karsa and Torvald kneel and when Karsa doesn’t and the warriors move toward their sword hilts, Karsa kills several. He kills all on deck then more in a cabin, including a mage, whom he kills by impaling him with a harpoon that pins him to the chair he was sitting in. As he does so, yelling “Urugal! Witness a Teblor’s rage!” he feels “something cold . . . the breath of someone unknown, nameless, but filled with rage.” Torvald discovers the oarsmen are decapitated bodies. Based on the fact the cabin group were looking at maps, Torvald thinks the grey-skinned warriors were as lost as he and Karsa. Back on deck, he wraps the severed heads in hides—”it’s too much to bear . . . Darkness would better suit them, all things considered.” When Karsa asks why, Torvald tells him they are Tiste Andii, who worship darkness. When Karsa says it’s a strange thing to worship, Torvald says “Perhaps the most realistic worship of all . . . How many of us bow before a god in the desperate hope that we can somehow shape our fate? Praying to that familiar face pushes away our terror of the unknown—the unknown being the future. Maybe these Tiste Andii are the only ones among us all who see the truth, the truth being oblivion.” When he adds it’s probably a good thing the Andii can’t speak or they’d have a “ghastly debate,” and Karsa asks if Torvald doubts his words, Torvald replies “Always Karsa.” As he speaks with Torvald, Karsa realizes he is no longer the same warrior who left the Teblor homelands, his experiences “had served as instruction on the complexities of the world. Subtlety had been a venomed serpent slithering unseen through is life. Its fangs had sunk deep . . . yet not once had he even understood the source of the pain. The poison itself had course deep within him, and the only answer he gave—when he gave one at all—was of violence, often misdirected, a lashing out on all sides . . . Who has dragged the cloth from my eyes . . . awakened Karsa . . . Not Urugal. He knew that for certain, for the otherworldly rage he had felt in the cabin . . . that had belonged to his god. A fierce displeasure—to which Karsa had felt himself oddly indifferent. The Seven Faces in the Rock never spoke of freedom. The Teblor were their servants. Their slaves.” A “milky, slimy” rain begins to fall and they load up the dory and head out toward the coastline.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Once they’ve left the ship, the seven Faces in the Rock rise from the slime, worrying about Karsa slipping their knots and about his increased doubts. One says, “The failure belonged to the Tiste Edur” and says they should be punished, to which another replies “Not for us to demand . . . We are not the masters in this scheme.” When one complains they’ve had “scant success thus far,” another argues “Untrue. The Shattered Warren stirs awake once more. The broken heart of the First Empire begins to bleed . . . We need only set our chosen warrior upon the proper current.” Their leader orders Ber’ok to scatter the Otataral dust in the cabin and says the Edur’s warren remains open and will quickly become a wound. He then says they have to move fast as they are being hunted: “there are kin upon our trail.”</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Karsa and Torvald make it to the coast and a breach in the large wall is causing a current pulling them in toward it. They spot Silgar and his men—their boat wrecked in the breach. They land near them and as Karsa moves toward Silgar to kill him, the slave master says he can save them by opening a portal. Torvald convinces Karsa they should let Silgar try so they take Silgar and his men into the dory. Silgar says he couldn’t try before because there was “no path before . . . But now, here, someone has opened a gate. Close . . . I can follow.” He guides them toward the breach where the water seemed to vanish, and they go over the edge into darkness then into water, the closing portal Silgar had borrowed closing over the dory, shearing it off and killing one of Silgar’s men—Borrug—(though nobody realizes this at first, thinking him merely unconscious). Torvald spots a light and they begin to swim toward it, Karsa taking Borrug on his back, realizing along the way that he was dead—his legs having been severed just below the knees by the portal closing. A huge shark attacks and grabs Borrug’s corpse off Karsa’s back. Karsa kills the fish, slicing its belly, then pulls Borrug’s body out of it. They make it to shore and Torvald wonders at Karsa going after a dead man. Karsa tells him “He was in my care . . . The shark had no right to him, whether he was dead or alive.” Torvald suspects the shark—Mael’s chosen beast of the sea—may have been called by Silgar, a priest of Mael.</p><p>Karsa and Torvald leave Silgar and Damisk on the beach and walk on, spotting a tower (the source of Torvald’s light) with a path leading to it. As they near it, Torvald realizes the tower is made of fossils. A huge man (by “lowlander standards”) steps out onto the path and speaks to them. Torvald says he recognizes a Malazan accent and assumes by his skin color he is Napan. The stranger leads them into the tower, past a huge stone skull—as long as Karsa is tall—that formed the doorway’s lintel. The stranger says he’s also collected most of the body, which has strangely “puny” forearms. Inside the tower is hollow and contains a framework supporting the lower half of a large skeleton. The man says he had built the tower too small and he’ll have to extend the roof. When Torvald introduces himself, the stranger recognizes the family name as being of the House of Torvald of Darujhistan, and tells them they are on Seven Cities’ northern coast, near the Otataral Sea and the city of Ehrlitan. He gives them tea and introduces himself as being known “locally” as Keeper, “Beyond that, in the fierce and unpleasant world, I’m not known at all, except as someone who died long ago.” He says in return for food they can spend a day or so helping him dismantle the roof. Karsa says he will not and calls what Keeper is doing pointless and a waste of his life and proclaims when he is hungry he will simply take food. Keeper lashes out with his fist and cracks several of Karsa’s ribs (breaking a few bones in his hand as well). Karsa thinks “He had never been hit so hard in his life” then passes out. He awakens the next day and finds Torvald and Keeper working on the ceiling. He joins them on the scaffold, painful as it is, much to Keeper’s surprise. Karsa shoves over a huge part of the wall and almost falls over with it, but is saved by Keeper, who says they’ve earned breakfast. Torvald tells Karsa that Silgar and Damisk had left the beach and probably headed for Ehrlitan.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>Torvald suggests to Karsa they head for Ehrlitan as well and take ship for home. Karsa says he will return to his people one day, “Urugal guides my steps still—I can feel him. Secrets have power so long as they remain secret. Bairoth Gild’s words, to which I gave little thought at the time. But now that has changed. I am changed. Mistrust has taken root in my soul and when I find Urugal’s . . . will warring with mine, I feel my own weakness. Urugal’s power over me lies in what I do not know, in secrets—secrets my own god would keep from me . . . I follow for our journey is to the truth.” When Torvald says Karsa may not like what he finds, Karsa says he suspects Torvald is right. Torvald tells him that Keeper says it’s unsafe being around Karsa, that “it’s as if you’re dragging a thousand invisible chains behind you, and whatever’s on the ends of each one of them is filled with venom.” Karsa, troubled by Keeper’s insight, tells Torvald the man is right—he is dangerous to be around—and so he will accompany Torvald to the port and see him board ship then part ways, thinking him a friend. He tells Torvald if it were not for his words on board the prisoner ship he would have gone mad: “I was a Teblor warleader. I was needed, but I myself did not need. I had followers, but not allies, and only now do I understand the difference. And it is vast . . . I have come to understand what it is to possess regrets. Bairoth Gild. Delum Thord. Even the Rathyd, whom I have greatly weakened. When I return . . . there are wounds I shall need to mend.” When they prepare to leave, Keeper gives them a lot of money, telling them “when a man arranges his own death, he needs to plan ahead . . . I emptied half of Aren’s treasury a day before my tragic drowning.” Karsa tells him he will return to repay him one day and when Keeper asks if he means for the money or the broken ribs, Karsa simply smiles. Keeper laughs and they leave.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Four</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>After a few days of travel, Torvald and Karsa enter a village and Torvald purchases a sword, complaining that the merchant spoke Malazan but wouldn’t admit it. Karsa says the Malazans in Genabaris had mentioned that Seven Cities would rebel and says this is why the Teblor way is better—instead of conquering they let the enemy keep their land so the Teblor can raid over and over. Torvald says the imperial way is “Possession and control . . . no doubt the Malazans have thought up countless justifications . . . It’s well known that Seven Cities was a rat’s warren of feuds and civil wars, leaving most of the population suffering and miserable and starving . . . and that with the Malazan conquest, the thugs ended up spiked . . . or on the run. And the wilder tribes no longer sweep down out of the hills . . . And the tyranny of the priesthoods was shattered, putting an end to human sacrifice and extortion. And of course, the merchants have never been richer, or safer on the roads. So, all in all, this land is rife for rebellion.” Karsa stares at him, then replies, “yes, I can see how that would be true,” to which Torvald responds: “you’re learning friend.” When Karsa refers to the “lessons of civilization,” Torvald says “just so. There’s little value in seeking to find reasons for why people do what they do . . . Hatred is a most pernicious weed, finding root in any soil. It feeds on itself.” As they walk through the village, they pick up signs not all is right, then realize they are walking into an ambush. They are caught between two groups (Arak tribesmen) totaling about 50 men with bows. Karsa asks how much damage the bows could do and Torvald says enough: “a year ago and Karsa would have attacked nonetheless. Now he simply reslung his bloodsword.” They are shackled and chained, Karsa so tightly as to cut off the blood to his hands and feet. Silgar appears, leading the men, and says he’s fine with that result. Karsa is knocked out and wakes tied to a sled amidst the Arak camp, his hands and feet numb and already turning blue. Torvald stuffs his and Karsa’s clothes with grass and nudges them against the small campfire sending up easily noticed flames/light. The Arak quickly decamp, muttering “Gral” with fear.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>As one of the Arak puts his knife to Torvald’s neck, a group of Gral suddenly attack. The Arak slices Torvald’s neck then is killed. Damisk and Silgar escape via magic with Karsa, leaving the writhing Torvald behind. They arrive in a city and Silgar orders Karsa unshackled as the city is under Malazan control and they don’t abide slavery unless the slave is branded a criminal (which Karsa is not). When they unshackle him, Karsa screams in pain, then continues, throwing off the magic Silgar tries to hit him with. He goes unconscious just as he hears a group of Malazan soldiers confronting Silgar and demanding to see Karsa’s brand when Silgar claims they are just subduing an escaped slave.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>As he swims back into consciousness he hears a Malazan healer saying he’d never seen such fast healing before and that any normal person would have needed their limbs amputated. The two Malazans wonder if he is a Fenn due to his size. Karsa pretends to still be unconscious as the Malazans leave, then sits up to find himself sharing a small room with a stranger who speaks a Seven Cities language, then switches to Malazan. The stranger tells him Silgar and Damisk have been arrested and are in the stocks, but had told them Karsa was en route to the Otataral mines and had cursed the ship to destruction. Karsa is being sent to the mines again, as is the stranger. He mentions Silgar has been collared on the ankle with an Otataral anklet, which he explains is a powdery rusty-colored substance that defies magic. Karsa says they use something similar to make their blood-oil, which they use on the swords, armor, and taste before battle. When the stranger asks how well magic works on him, Karsa replies not very well at all. The stranger tells him the Malazans control Otataral production very tightly and believe it to only be found on Otataral island and warns Karsa to not let it slip there is another source or the Empire will try to crush his people. When Karsa says “The Teblor have many enemies,” the stranger laughs at what they call themselves. Before he can say why, though, a group of soldiers enters to transport them. They tell Karsa he’s been tattooed as an escaped prisoner: “‘shattered, the other prisoner said, ‘the brand makes your face look like it’s been shattered.” As they move, the soldiers discuss how their Fist is “cowering in his keep” and how they worry that regiments (such as the Ashok we met earlier) from Seven Cities might join the rebellion if it happens. When they were passing Silgar in the stocks, Karsa asks what will happen to him. When the soldier mentions Silgar’s claim that he is rich back in Genabackis and Karsa mocks a system that would let Silgar buy freedom, the soldier tells him that doesn’t happen under Imperial law if the crimes are serious, but he may be just fined—which for a merchant hurts a lot. Karsa is chained (more humanely) alongside his cellmate, who proposes the two partner to guard each other’s back in the mines. At night, Torvald Nom appears with some Gral and trading agents of the House of Nom. He frees both Karsa and his partner. Torvald tells Karsa the Gral saved him to try and ransom him. He adds his kin have offered him a place, but the Gral won’t take Karsa, as he is too noticeable. The stranger offers Karsa a place of safety and Karsa agrees to go with him. As the alarm rings out, Torvald gives Karsa his bloodsword that he’d saved from before and tells Karsa to come to Darujhistan in a few years to visit. The stranger leads Karsa out of the city, passing through a doorway held by a man named Mebra. Outside, the stranger tells him it will take some days of travel to reach safety. Karsa warns him he will not be taken prisoner again and the stranger says Karsa is free to head off his own way at any time.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>The next day Karsa and the stranger are pursued by horsemen; the stranger suspects Mebra betrayed him. When they can’t lose them, the stranger concludes they have a mage. Karsa decides he will attack them at dark.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Night falls and the stranger and Karsa spy on the pursuers, which include Silgar and Damisk. Karsa attacks, killing several and driving others off. He cuts off Silgar’s hands and feet, then binds them so Silgar doesn’t die: “he has not earned swift death. He is as a mad dog, to be driven into a hut and killed . . . once I have driven him mad.”</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Eight days later they cross a path and look over the desert Raraku. Karsa asks why his people’s name—Teblor—continually amuses the stranger. The stranger tells him: “Your kind walked this earth when the T’lan Imass were still flesh. From your blood came the Barghast and the Trell. You are Thelomen Toblakai.” He then names himself Leoman, and says he serves Sha’ik.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.2546350644919094">Back in Aren, Commander Blistig has been ordered by Fist Gamet (head of Adjunct Tavore’s newly landed army) to find Squint, the archer who killed Coltaine. The scene opens with them pulling him—drunk, covered in vomit—out of a tavern. Gamet complains about the lack of decorum/discipline. Blistig reminds him angrily how he and his garrison, under orders, were forced to watch Coltaine and his men get cut down, then watch again as Pormqual led the army out to slaughter. He tells Gamet “Go to Hood with our military decorum.” Gamet thinks how he’s seen Blistig’s anger before, how all those who had survived the Chain of Dogs—either those Duiker brought in or those forced to watch the end—were filled with rage; he believes their hope had shattered and they were too brittle, too broken to be used as soldiers and melded with Tavore’s untested recruits. Gamet orders Squint cleaned up and locked up, then tells Blistig that his plan to be obviously insubordinate and thus get imprisoned and sent back to Unta won’t work—that he and his soldiers were needed. Blistig says it would have been better had they died with Coltaine and Gamet answers they hadn’t died, though, and so needed to be models for the recruits. Blistig disparages Gamet, mocking that Tavore turned her House Guard captain into a Fist. Gamet replies that he is a 23-year veteran of the Fourth Army and of the Wickan Wars and was retired after a wound that should have killed him. Gamet informs Blistig Tavore is calling a meeting of all the commanders tonight.</span></p><p>SCENE 2</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.2546350644919094">On the last transport, Strings watches Aren draw closer, thinking it had changed little since he saw it last years ago. He thinks how he has left his old life behind, save for one item buried in his kit bag. He is joined by Lieutenant Ranal, who in Strings’ mind “embodied the worst of Malazan military command. Nobleborn, commission purchased . . . arrogant and inflexible and righteous . . . a walking death sentence to his soldiers.” Ranal remarks how Fiddler is old enough to be most recruits’ father, and how the recruiting officer had seen that he was a veteran and considered him a “valuable resource,” suggesting that Ranal make him a sergeant. Ranal says he thinks Strings is a deserter. Strings replies he’s met a bunch, but one thing he can guarantee is deserters don’t end up putting themselves back into recruiting lines. He heads off to another part of the ship. Another soldier, a half-Seti named Koryk, tells him that Ranal has it out for Strings. Strings tells Koryk that despite rumors, there are survivors and veterans of the Chain of Dogs in Aren. Along with the Aren Guard and the Red Blades as well as some coastal marines and Nok’s fleet, though he says Nok will probably keep the fleet intact. When asked why by another recruit (one which reminds him of another young woman “who’d marched alongside him a while ago,” he answers that Nok can be used to recapture coast cities—the ports the ground army will need. One of the recruits says Tavore is likely a fool as she’s nobleborn and Strings thinks she may be right, though then thinks that she is sister to Captain Paran and he “had shown some spine in Darujhistan.” A soldier asked where he got the name Strings and he replies, “That tale’s too long to tell, lass.”</span></p><p>SCENE 3</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.2546350644919094">Lostara Yil awaits someone who had sent a cryptic message to meet in a bar, though she’s pretty sure she’s figured out it’s Pearl. She is Tene Baralta’s aide (Baralta commands the Red Blades) and she thinks how the Red Blades are being kept separate from the army, despite the army’s noted lack of veterans. Baralta, despite having met with Tavore three times, still can’t tell if Tavore doesn’t trust the Blades. Pearl arrives and when Lostara says he probably knows what Tavore thinks of the Red Blades, he says the Adjunct “is as unfathomable to me as she is to you,” but that the Red Blades aren’t alone in being left out of her counsel—she speaks to hardly anybody. He informs her of the meeting tonight and says that he has gotten permission from Lostara to have her as his aide in a particular upcoming task, which the two of them will learn the details of after the meeting.</span></p><p>SCENE 4</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.2546350644919094">Gamet awaits Tavore’s arrival at the meeting. He feels intimidated due to his belief that his promotion to Fist had nothing to do with “merit” but instead was based on the fact that Tavore knew him and was familiar with him as an organizer/administrator and was going to use him in the same manner as Fist, something he is aware that everyone else knows as well. Nok, Blistig, and Baralta are also present. Gamet thinks how Nok is the last of the Emperor’s commanders, the “only admiral who didn’t drown.” He believes had Pormqual not kept Nok’s fleet in Aren, the Chain of Dogs never would have happened and the rebellion would have most likely already been over, though Nok’s own thoughts on the matter are impossible to know. Gamet knows Baralta is concerned over Tavore’s attitude toward the Red Blades, but Gamet has no idea what Tavore has concluded about them. Tavore enters, plainly dressed and wearing an otataral sword. Without ceremony, she divvies up command assignments for the Fourteenth Army, with Gamet, Blistig, and Baralta each commanding one legion. The Chain of Dogs survivors and other unattached units are broken up and dispersed among the larger army. She dismisses Blistig and Baralta (now named Fists) and then Nok, though she says she wishes to meet with him later. Alone with Gamet, she remarks how easily that went and Gamet says they were probably in shock as usually “the imperial style of command includes discussions, argument, compromise” at which she only smiles. When asked, he says he thinks Baralta will choose his officers from among the Red Blades, Blistig will choose Captain Keneb who had warned Blistig about Mallick Rel but beyond Keneb the pickings are slim. When Gamet says he “feels for Blistig,” Tavore says she thinks what bothers Blistig most is not that he had to watch Coltaine’s fall, but that he “disobeyed a High Fist’s order. He stands before me, his new commander, and believes that it would be best for everyone concerned if I were to send him to Unta, to face the Empress.”</span><br/>Nil, Nether, and Temul enter, with Nil and Nether looking terrible and disinterested. Tavore informs the two that they are now Mages in the Fourteenth Army and when they try to say no, she says they have no choice. When they tell her the “warlock spirits within us are silent,” she simply informs them they have to find some way to wake them up again. She asks Temul if the older Wickan warriors resent his command and he adamantly says no. She attaches the Wickans to her personal entourage as bodyguards, saying she doesn’t have the forces to really use cavalry. Temul begins to object, referring to Coltaine, and she interrupts and bluntly tells him “This is no longer Coltaine’s war.” She dismisses them, then asks Gamet why he thinks Nok didn’t simply take command from Pormqual, why did he permit the loss of Coltaine and the others. Gamet has no answer. She mentions that the Empress never had reason to doubt Nok’s loyalty and Gamet mutters she had not reason to doubt Dujek either, which raises a smile from Tavore.</p><p>She leads Gamet into another room and he sees a momentary vulnerability in her eyes before she recovers and then tells him “in this room the Empress is not present.” Pearl and Lostara enter. Pearl notes Tavore has taken care to ensure this meeting was secret, and also that he has angered/disappointed both Laseen and Topper (the Claw master), making him “something of a loose end at the moment.” She says she’s considering asking him to perform a more personal, private task, which makes Lostara uncomfortable as the Adjunct “is the will of the Empress. No other considerations are permitted her.” Tavore agrees, then asks Pearl about the Talon. He says they no longer exist and when Tavore challenges his honesty, he admits they do, digging in deeper whenever the Claw try to root them out. Tavore says they do serve a “certain function,” and Pearl connects that to support among the nobility and when Tavore says yes, he thinks for a moment then says, “name him.” Tavore says “Baudin” and when Pearl scoffs he was assassinated years ago (leaving Claw corpses “scattered in alleys throughout the city), she informs him that was Baudin Elder, but she is referring to the son, whose skills are as good. She says she employed him but now fears something has gone wrong and Gamet mentions Felisin. Pearl asks when she lost contact and she tells him the night of the uprising, though there had been a “loss of control for some weeks before then.” She gives Pearl and Lostara a scroll with more information and asks them to find her sister.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.2546350644919094">Gamet flashes back to Unta, the Season of Rot and the Cull. He is at the gatehouse with a trio of guards while inside hides Felisin—her parents already arrested and taken, her brother thought dead, and her sister become adjunct. He dismisses the three guards but only two leave. The other, about whom Gamet knew nothing but had sensed hidden martial skill and confidence, stays. Gamet thinks he is working for the Empress but the guard, known as Kollen, tells him he is under Tavore’s orders: he is to see “no harm is to come to her [Felisin].” Gamet is suspicious, noting Tavore had done nothing for her parents and had said nothing to suggest Felisin would fare differently, to which Kollen (Baudin) says the Adjunct options are “limited. She is under some scrutiny.” He tells Gamet Felisin is to spend a “brief stint in the otataral mines” with a guardian—him. Gamet warns Baudin that if any harm comes to Felisin he will hunt Baudin down no matter that he is a Claw. Baudin responds he is not a Claw, but unfortunately “there will be some [harm]; it cannot be helped. We must hope she is resilient—it is a Paran trait, yes?” Gamet accepts what Baudin says and asks, willing to accept this as well, if Baudin is supposed to kill him and the other guards now or later. Baudin says not at all, but Gamet is to escort him to a safe house on the Avenue of Souls, which Gamet sadly realizes means Felisin will face “Judgment’s Round. To the chains.” He goes to wake Felisin.</span></p><p>SCENE 6</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.2546350644919094">Pearl and Lostara are alone in the room; Pearl has been studying the information for a while. Lostara tells him she won’t have anything to do with the job. Pearl says fine, but he’ll have to kill her so she doesn’t say anything. She asks wince when does he do the Adjunct’s bidding and he answers since she “unequivocally reasserted her loyalty to the Empress.” Lostara says she didn’t hear that and he explains the “unnaturally swift” return of the nobles to power has been linked in rumor to the Talons, but none of those who confessed to being a Talon weren’t even close to the real things. Tavore has told Pearl that the Talons exist and have been making use of the nobles, “placing sympathetic agents in the military and administration.” Now that Tavore has shifted from being a noble to being Adjunct, her “old loyalties must needs be severed . . . She has given us the Talons. We will find this Baudin Younger, and from him we will unravel the entire organization.” He continues explaining that Tavore didn’t tell him and Lostara that the mission directly helps the Empire because it is secondary to Tavore’s primary goal (finding Felisin) and because the Empress wouldn’t be thrilled to learn about Tavore’s deceit re Felisin. Lostara agrees to take on the mission.</span></p><p>SCENE 7</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.2546350644919094">Tavore and Gamet meet with Nok. Gamet feels superfluous to the whole thing and recalls how when Tavore first brought him in he’d thought of slipping away, but hadn’t out of simple curiosity. Continuing his conversation with Tavore, Nok says he heard the transport ship she asked about had sank in Malaz harbor, with Pormqual’s treasure aboard, while none of the crew seemed to have survived; lots of empty dories were found. When Tavore expresses some skepticism that sharks ate everyone and left no remains. Nok says he knows of a dozen examples. Tavore interrupts to name one—the Twisted, Kellanved’s flagship “which mysteriously slipped its moorings the night after the assassinations, then promptly plummeted into the deeps, taking its resident demon with it.” When Nok begins to speak, she interrupts again and says only Nok and three others “are left.” Gamet thinks of Tayschrenn, Dujek, and Whiskeyjack, listing the fallen: Tattersail, Bellurdan, Nightchill, Duiker. Tavore continues, telling Nok she isn’t interested in the details, nor does she ask for the Empress, but she is personally curious as to “why they abandoned her.” Gamet thinks Tavore “asks questions of loyalty, as would someone who has never experienced it. You reveal . . . what can only be construed as a critical flaw. You command the Fourteenth Army, Adjunct, yet you do so in isolation, raising the very barricades you must needs take down if you would truly lead.” </span><br/>Nok says the answer to her question “lies in what was both a strength and a flaw of the Emperor’s family . . .. Kellanved began with but one companion—Dancer. The two then hired a handful of locals . . .. Myself, Ameron, Dujek . . . Hawl my wife . . . The Napan Isles has just been annexed by Unta and were providing a staging point for the Untan king’s planned invasion of Kartool . . . Our residency in the Deadhouse rewarded us with—as is now clearly evident—certain gifts. Longevity, immunity to most diseases, and other things . . . Dancer later bolstered our number by recruiting among the refugee Napans who’d fled the conquest: Cartheron Crust and his brother, Urko. And Surly—Laseen. Three more . . . . Toc Elder, Dassem Ultor . . . and a renegade High Septarch of the D’rek Cult, Tayschrenn. And finally, Duiker.” He says his wife was one of the casualties in the drive toward conquering Malaz Island and Mock, then said “To answer you Adjunct. Unknown to the rest of us, the Napans among us were far more than simple refugees. Surly was of the royal line. Crust and Urko had been captains in the Napan fleet, a fleet that would have likely repelled the Untans if it hadn’t been virtually destroyed by a sudden storm. As it turned out, theirs was a singular purpose—to crush the Untan hegemony—and they planned on using Kellanved to achieve that. In a sense, that was the first betrayal within the family, the first fissure. Easily it healed, it seemed, since Kellanved already possessed imperial ambitions, and of the two major rivals on the mainland, Unta was by far the fiercest.” Tavore says it seems clear that Surly’s killing of Kellanved and Dancer wrecked the family “irrevocably, but that is where my understanding falters. Surly had taken the cause to its penultimate conclusion. Yet it was not you, Tayschrenn, Duiker, Dassem Ultor, or Toc Elder who disappeared. It was Napans.” When Gamet points out Ameron was the exception, Nok tells them Ameron was half Napan. When Gamet wonders why only Napans deserted the new Empress, who was of the royal Napan line, Nok tells them “Shame is a fierce, vigorous poison. To now serve the new Empress—complicity and damnation. Curst, Urko, and Ameron were not party to the betrayal, but who would believe them?” He says Laseen hadn’t included any of them in her scheme and just used the Claw. Gamet asks where the Talons were, and Nok says he has no idea, as he wasn’t in Malaz City; he just knows they disappeared and it was thought the Claw got rid of them. Tavore dismisses him and Gamet, after asking Gamet where T’amber was.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.2546350644919094">Strings enters the stables where the other recruits are. He watches as Koryk, the half-Seti, cuts long strands from a piece of hide and thinks how he’s seen Koryk’s type before—the ones “obsessed” with tying things—fetishes, loot, etc.—to their bodies. He recalls the Seti past: fighting a centuries-long war with the city-states of Quon and Li Heng, greatly outnumbered as they defended the “barely inhabitable lands that had been their traditional home.” Their lands had been “pacified” for sixty years now—”almost three generations had lived in that ambivalent, ambiguous border that was the edge of civilization. The various tribes had dissolved into a single, murky nation, with mixed-bloods coming to dominate the population.” Strings believes that had been the cause of Coltaine’s rebellion/the Wickan Wars, as Coltaine tried to prevent the same happening to his own people. Strings divides up cultures not into right and wrong but into “inward-looking . . . and aggressive.” The first can’t fight the second, “without metamorphosing into some other thing, a thing twisted by the exigencies of desperation and violence” and he thinks how the Seti—known now as horse warriors—had never even ridden them before. He wonders if Koryk’s choice to follow the old ways, join the army not as a horseman but a marine, was evidence of “the clash in the man’s scarred soul.”</span></p><p>He introduces himself to the 4th squad as their sergeant and tells them their commander (of the 9th Company) is Captain Keneb while the entire 8th Legion is commanded by Fist Gamet. He asks their names and the squad introduces themselves. Tarr is from Li Heng and was nicknamed that because he can’t be moved once he’s planted behind his shield. Strings makes him corporal. One of the women recruits is named Smiles because “she never does.” Another recruit is called Bottle. He asks who their drill sergeant was and when Koryk answers Braven Tooth, Strings is surprised “that bastard’s still alive.” He remembers how it had been Braven who’d named most of the Bridgeburners: Whiskeyjack . . . Hedge . . . Toes. Fiddler himself had avoided a new name through his basic training; it had been Whiskeyjack who’d named him on that first ride through Raraku. Smiles asks who named Braven Tooth and Strings say he doesn’t know, but thinks “I did, after the bastard left one of his in my shoulder the night of the brawl . . . Gods, so many years ago.” Strings asks Bottle where his sword is and Bottle says he doesn’t use one; he uses “this and that” instead and is good at scouting. Strings thinks he “smells like a mage . . . only he doesn’t want to advertise it.” Smiles says she scouts as well but unlike Bottle “finishes” with her knives. Six more soldiers appear—the 5th squad led by Gesler and Stormy. Strings notes the “strange, burnished cast” to their skin, as well as on a younger soldier (Truth). Strings names them Adjutant Stormy and Captain Gesler but Gesler interrupts and says those titles aren’t theirs anymore; he’s a sergeant and Stormy his Corporal. He introduces the others: Truth, Tavos Pond, Sands, and Pella, mentioning that Pella was a guard at the otataral mines. Stormy’s eyes narrow “suspiciously” when Strings introduces himself and asks “Hey Gesler, think we should have done that? Changes our names? This Strings here is Old Guard.” Gesler replies, “let the bastard keep whatever name he wants.” Strings and Gesler exit for a private talk and Strings says “I can picture Whiskeyjack’s jaw dropping—the day I tell him you was my fellow sergeant in the new 8th Legion.” He asks about the Adjunct and Gesler says, “She’s as cold as Hood’s forked tongue” and says she confiscated the Silanda. He wonders about how she hasn’t ever commanded anything other than her noble house and yet she’s been given an army and told to reconquer a continent. He mentions he knows of only one Falari in the Bridgeburners and Strings admits he’s Fiddler. They head to a tavern to swap stories, each thinking they have the best one.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER SIX</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3950415338198773">Apsalar, her father Rellock, and Crokus have returned to Sorry’s home—Itko Kan—to find it empty of people. The night before Rellock died in his sleep and Hood himself or one of his minions appear to have come to collect Rellock’s soul. While Apsalar mourns over the body, Crokus thinks how he has come to know her less and less and feels what lies at her core is not fully human. He muses on Cotillion who had possessed her and his move toward ascendancy: “it seemed to him, to ascend was also to </span>surrender. Embracing what to all intents and purposes could be called immortality, was, he had begun to believe, presaged by a turning away. Was it not a mortal’s fate—fate he knew was the wrong word, but he could think of no other—was it not a mortal’s fate, then, to embrace life itself, as one would a lover? Life, with all its fraught, momentary fragility. And could life not be called a mortal’s first lover? A lover whose embrace was then rejected in that fiery crucible of ascendancy? Crokus wondered how far she had gone down that path—for it was a path she was surely on.” He is attracted himself and wonders if she wants him to ascend with her, and if so, is it him or could it just be anyone, someone. He ponders if “fear of dying lies at the root of ascendancy” and believes if that’s the case, “he would never make it, for . . . [he] had lost that fear.” He recalls how Shadowthrone had sent him, Apsalar, and Rellock to an alley in Kan (rather than the village as promised) and he and Apsalar had contracted to kill men who had been extorting a bookmaker in the alley. The next morning “Crokus has acquired a new name, Cutter. At first, he had rejected it . . . Murdering killers was still murder, the act like the closing of shackles between them all, joining a line of infinite length, one killer to the next, a procession from which there was no escape. His mind had recoiled from the name . . . But that had proved a short-lived rectitude. The two murderers had died indeed—at the hands of the man named Cutter. Not Crokus, not the Daru youth, the cut-purse—who had vanished, probably never to be seen again.” He decides he, or “Cutter” would walk the path of ascendancy with Apsalar: “The Emperor had Dancer, yes? . . . a companion was what was needed, is needed. No she has Cutter . . . Who dances in his chains as if they were weightless threads . . . And therein resided the final truth. Anyone could become a killer. Anyone at all.”</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3950415338198773">Kalam rides through Shadow and stops beside some broken pillars from which chains descend into the ground. He pulls on a chain and a desiccated limb rises and when the hand twitches, he drops it. “Pillars, columns, tree stumps . . . for every dozen there was one among them holding a prisoner. None of whom seemed capable of dying . . . their minds had died—most of them—long ago. Raving in tongues . . . begging forgiveness, offering bargains, though not one had yet—within Kalam’s hearing—proclaimed its own innocence.” As he rides on, he wonders what is going on with Quick Ben (he hasn’t heard anything from him) or Fiddler, whom he knows reenlisted. He envies that at least they were doing something more than babysitting 1300 children, and besides, he thinks Minala and Apt had it in hand without his help, teaching them “a host of life skills . . . stealth, tracking, the laying of ambushes, the setting of traps . . . countless other weapon skills, the weapons themselves donated by the warren’s mad rulers—half of them cursed or haunted or fashioned for entirely unhuman hands. The children took to such training with frightening zeal and the gleam of pride in Minala’s eyes left the assassin chilled. And army in the making for Shadowthrone.” He pulls up in front of a gate swarming with shadows. Cotillion and two hounds appear and caution him to be careful because the shadows “have lost their masters but anyone will do” and then he asks if Kalam is seeking to leave. Kalam tells him he’s bored and Minala has banished him, then asks what Cotillion wants. When Cotillions remarks on Kalam’s lack of “obeisance to [his] patron”, Kalam replies: “Since when have you expected it . . . if it was fanatical worshippers you hungered for, you should never have looked to assassins. By our very natures, we’re antithetical to the notion of subservience—as if you weren’t already aware of that . . . Mind you, you stood at Kellanved’s side, through to the end. Dancer, it seems, knew both loyalty and servitude.” When Cotillion questions “servitude?” Kalam says “Mere expedience? That seems difficult to countenance, given all that the two of you went through.” He then tells Cotillion to spit out what he obviously is there for: “you need me for something, only you’ve never learned how to </span>ask.” Cotillion says he’s going to be very busy but he needs other things taken care of and it’s been hard to find someone “of practical use.” When Kalam laughs “you went fishing for faithful servants and found your subjects wanting,” Cotillion dryly responds, “We could argue interpretation all day.” Kalam finds Cotillion’s irony appealing: “he admitted that he actually liked Cotillion . . . Certainly, between the Patron of Assassins and Shadowthrone, only the former seemed to possess any shred of self-examination—and thus was actually capableof being humbled.” After some words, Kalam asks Cotillion if he thinks his realm is being contested (Cotillion murmurs “my realm”) and Cotillion says it’s hard to tell, but there have been “trembles, agitation.” Kalam assumes Cotillion wants to “know more of your potential enemy” and Cotillion agrees and says Kalam should start at “a confluence to your own desires, I suspect.”</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3950415338198773">Crokus/Cutter is on the beach trying to figure out what he and Apsalar are gong to do. He feels a stranger in the Malazan Empire and recognizes the same is not true for Apsalar: “She seemed possessed of absolute calm . . . the confidence of the god who once possessed her had left something of a permanent imprint on her soul. Not just confidence . . . deadly skills and the icy precision necessary when using them and . . . many of the god’s own memories remained with her. Cotillion appears with the hound Blind to speak to Apsalar (she’s gone for a walk). Cutter tells him of Rellock and Cotillion says it is “unfortunate” then, looking at Cutter, asks if Cotillion is now his patron. Cutter says he thinks so and Cotillion declares himself pleased. Cotillion asks if he should bless Cutter’s knives and Cutter answers only if he can do it without magic. Cotillion wonders if Cutter wishes to follow Rallick’s path and Cutter says he’d find it hard to do because Rallick was so good. Cotillion agrees Rallick was “formidable” but says Cutter is selling himself short, adding that Cutter needn’t use the past tense re Rallick—saying he suspects Rallick and Vorcan are alive. He asks if Cutter will do a service and when Cutter replies, “isn’t that expected” Cotillion says he won’t take advantage of Cutter’s inexperience. Instead, he says, they’ll “begin things on a proper footing. Reciprocity, Cutter. A relationship of mutual exchanges.” Cutter says Cotillion should have done the same with Apsalar and Cotillion agrees, saying, “Consider this new tact the consequences of difficult lessons.” Cutter says in payment then, he wants answers to why Cotillion and Shadowthrone plotted against Laseen and the Empire; he wants to know why they did what they did to Apsalar. After a long pause, Cotillion replies: “necessities . . . Games are played, and what may appear precipitous might well be little more than a feint. Or perhaps it was the city itself, Darujhistan, that it would serve our purposes better if it remained free, independent. There are layers of meaning behind every gesture, every gambit. I will not explain myself any further.” Cutter challenges him whether he feels regret and Cotillion says, “Yes. Many, many regrets. One day, perhaps, you will see for yourself that regrets are as nothing. The value lies in how they are answered.” After telling Cotillion about throwing Oponn’s coin into the sea because he didn’t like their attention, he demands that in return for his service he gets to call on Blind if he gets in trouble, saying “her attention comforts me.” Cotillion agrees.</span></p><p>SCENE 4</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3950415338198773">Apsalar returns and senses right away that Cotillion had been there. Cutter says they are to explore an island that “is getting farther by the moment.” Apsalar responds “Ah. Of course.” The two set sail.</span></p><p>SCENE 5</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.3950415338198773">Onrack wanders through the Nascent, looking at catfish that had climbed onto the wall. He examines one and thinks it isn’t dead, that this is metamorphosis. He notes the many breaches in the wall and the shallow sea forming, thinking soon the wall’s fragments will eventually be islands. He thinks “The sea’s torrential arrival had caught them unawares, scattering them . . . Other kin had survived . . . to link once more so that the hunt could resume. But Kurald Emurlahn, fragmented or otherwise, was not amenable to the T’lan Imass . . . Onrack could not extend his Telann powers, could not reach out to his kin . . .For most of his kind, that alone would have been sufficient cause for surrender. The roiling waters . . . offered true oblivion. Dissolution was the only escape possible from this eternal ritual and even among the Logros—Guardians of the First Throne itself—Onrack knew of kin who had chosen that path. Or worse.” He rejects the idea, though, “far less haunted by his immortality than most T’lan Imass. There was always something else to see, after all.” As he walks on, he thinks, “This fragment of the long-fractured Tiste Edur warren was by far the largest he had come across, larger even than the one that surrounded Tremorlor, the Azath Odhanhouse. And this one had known a period of stability, sufficient for civilizations to arise . . . although those inhabitants had not been Tiste Edur.” He can sense Edur have passed through recently. Eventually he reaches Trull, chained to the wall. He looks at him, then begins to move on. Trull says he wants to bargain for his freedom and Onrack says he isn’t interested. Trull says he can tell Onrack of his enemies and when Onrack replies he never said he had any, Trull responds, “Oh, but you do. I should know. I was once one of them, and indeed, that is why you find me here, for I am your enemy no longer.” When Onrack wonders why he should trust a traitor to his own kind, Trull says, “To my own kind, I am not a traitor. That epithet belongs to the one who chained me here.” Trull piques Onrack’s curiosity when he says he is plagued by the need to be truthful and Onrack breaks Trull’s chains and drags him along the top of the wall. After a while, when Trull warns he’ll die soon, Onrack stops dragging him and agrees to help find food. Trull asks if Onrack can open a portal to get them out of the warren and Onrack says no. They exchange names, each labeling himself “clanless.” Onrack kills one of the catfish which sparks a birthing as bodies tear themselves free of the other catfish: “the beasts moved on squat, muscular legs, three-toed feet thickly padded and clawed. Their tails were short.” They attack and Onrack kills them all and brings back one for them to cook. Trull tells him “Our encounters with your kind . . . were few and far between. And then, only after your ritual. Prior to that, your people fled from us at first sight. Apart from those who traveled the oceans with the Thelomen Toblakai, that is. Those ones fought us. For centuries, before we drove them from the seas.” Onrack says “The Tiste Edur were in my world . . . just after the coming of the Tiste Andii. Once numerous . . . ” Trull informs him the Edur are “far fewer . . . We came here—to this place—from Mother Dark, whose children had banished us. We did not think they would pursue, but they did. And upon the shattering of this warren, we fled yet again—to your world . . . where we thrived [until our enemies found us]. The first of those were fanatical in their hatred. There were great wars—unwitnessed by anyone, fought as they were within darkness, in hidden places of shadow. In the end, we slew the last of those first Andii, but were broken ourselves . . . and retreated into remote places . . . Then more Andii came, only these seemed less interested. And we in turn had grown inward, no longer consumed with the hunger of expansion . . . We had forgotten it all . . . Until a short while ago. My people—the last bastion it seems of the Tiste Edur—knew almost nothing of our past . . . And what we knew was in fact false. If only we had remained ignorant.” Onrack looks at him and says, “Your people no longer look inward.” Trull replies that “there are your kind, Onrack, among the Tiste Edur. In league with our new purpose . . . A terrible purpose.” When Trull would continue, Onrack tells him not to, thinking to himself “Because your truth would burden me. Force me to find my kin . . . chain me to this world—to my world, once more. And I am not ready for that.” As the sky lightens, Trull says, “The suns return. Here in the Nascent, the ancient twin hearts of Kurald Emurlahn live on. There was no way of telling, for we did not rediscover this warren until after the Breach. The floodwaters must have brought chaos to the climate. And destroyed the civilization that existed here.” When Onrack asks if they were Edur, Trull replies, “No, more like your descendants, Onrack . . . They are as vermin, these humans of yours.” When Onrack denies humans are “his”, Trull wonders if he takes no pride at their “insipid success.” Onrack says “They are prone to mistakes . . . The Logros have killed them in their thousands when the need to reassert order made doing so necessary. With ever greater frequency they annihilate themselves, for success breeds contempt for those very qualities that purchased it . . . More than my kin, perhaps, the edge of my irritation with humankind remains jagged.” Trull tells him bitterly the Nascent “required cleansing . . . or so it was judged” and Onrack replies “your methods are more extreme than what the Logros would choose,” to which Trull says, “sometimes what is begun proves too powerful to contain.” They leave the wall and head for some hills, Onrack carrying Trull eventually as a storm arrives. Onrack notes “a strange regularity to the hills . . . There were seven in all, arrayed in what seemed a straight line, each of equally height though uniquely misshapen.” When they get nearer, they can see “The hills . . . were edifices, massive and hulking . . . Twenty or more man-lengths high. Dog-like beasts . . . the vast pits of their eyes faintly gleaming a deep, translucent amber.” Onrack asks what Trull senses and Trull answers “Nothing, but I know what they are meant to represent. As do you. It seems the inhabitants of this realm made t hem into their gods.” Trull tells Onrack there should be a gate beyond, then asks why Onrack is hesitating. Onrack tells him two of the statues are alive.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Seven</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Back near Sha’ik’s camp in Raraku, Heboric is climbing up a rise to collect hen’bara flowers on it, which can be dried and steeped to make a soothing tea. Heboric thinks how life cannot be “bloodless. Spill that of those blocking your path. Spill your own. Struggle on . . . with all the frenzy that is the brutal unveiling of self-preservation. The macabre dance in the tugging currents held no artistry, and to pretend otherwise was to sink into delusion.” He believes he has no delusions any longer; “He had drowned them one by one with his own hands.” For others in the camp, however, he thinks “such clear-eyed vision was absent . . . guided by a will . . . that was drowning in delusions.” His bemoans that his vision has been failing, as well as the fact that he is trapped in the desert, the Whirlwind wall impassable in either direction. He is joined atop the ridge by Felisin’s adopted daughter—Felisin Younger, who carries scrolls of Felisin’s poem “Call to Shadow, a continuation of a poem by Felisin’s own mother. Felisin Younger tells Heboric that Korbolo Dom, whom army he has named “dogslayers,” is afraid and lists whom he is afraid of when Heboric rejects the idea: Leoman. Toblakai. Bidithal. L’oric. Mathok. And the one he finds most terrifying of all: Sha’ik” She adds that Felisin has banished Mallick Rel and Pullyk Alar, and Dom sees that as the removal of two of his allies. Heboric tells her “the Whirlwind Goddess whispers in the Chosen One’s ears. There are secrets with the Warren of Shadow . . . containing truths that are relevant to the Whirlwind itself . . . The sundering of an ancient warren scattered fragments throughout the realms. The Whirlwind Goddess possesses power, but it was not her own, not at first. Just one more fragment, wandering, lost and in pain. What was the goddess, I wonder, when she first stumbled onto the Whirlwind? Some desert tribe’s minor deity, I suspect . . . it did not take her long for her to destroy her old rivals.” Felisin Younger questions how that explains all that came afterward—the Seven Holy Cities, the prophecy of Dryjhna, etc. Heboric answers that religions feed on each other, coopt other myths. Seven cities, he says, built upon an earlier legacy—an ancient civilization that itself was built upon the ruins of an even older one—the First Empire of the T’lan Imass. Anything that is still recalled is mere chance. Felisin Younger tells him she was sent to say Leoman wanted to see him in the pit temple. The two return to camp and Heboric, noting its “ills” sees it as a microcosm of Seven Cities and as proof that the Empire’s conquest was beneficial as it ameliorated or removed many of them. Passing through the Circle of Temples, he thinks of how the children that once thronged there have been adopted by Felisin: “her private retinue, the Whirlwind cult’s own acolytes . . . over three thousand.” The act had angered the pimps exploiting the children. As they prepare to head down to the pit temple, Heboric thinks how Sha’ik had looked into Leoman’s soul “and found it empty, bereft of faith, by some flaw of nature inclined to disavow all forms of certainty.” She could no longer trust him fully and so put him as second to her general Mathok. Heboric recalls the rumors that Karsa and Leoman has once “shared a chain” as Malazan prisoners. Felisin leaves and Heboric climbs down into the pit temple, which smells of Leoman’s durhang use. Leoman tells Heboric that Bidithal is “back to his old ways . . . with children . . . Girls. His unpleasant hungers.” When Heboric asks what Leoman expects him to do about it, as Felisin appears to no longer listen to him while Bidithal is her High Mage. Leoman says that all three of them (Heboric, Leoman, Karsa) care about Felisin Younger and she has “caught Bidithal’s eye. But that attention is more than simply sexual . . . Bidithal believes she must be shaped in a manner identical to her mother . . . As the mother was broken inside, so too must the child be broken inside.” Heboric says Sha’ik should be told, but Leoman says she has been, but because she needs Bidithal to balance out Febryl and L’oric (the other High Mages), she won’t do anything outright, but has told Leoman, Karsa, and Heboric to “be watchful.” In response to Heboric saying Bidithal should just be killed, Leoman says Bidithal actually isn’t the problem; he may in fact be Sha’ik’s savior as he will divulge Febryl’s co-conspirators when Febryl invites him into the conspiracy. Right now Leoman is only sure of L’oric, but he says traitors could be Dom, Kamist Reloe, the lesser mages Henaras and Fayelle. Heboric worries that all the command structure might be compromised, but Leoman says it won’t matter: Sha’ik has the Whirlwind, she has Mathok and him to lead the armies, and L’oric as a mage, but Dom is more of a liability than a plus. Heboric realizes then that Leoman lied, that Sha’ik actually hasn’t been told and this is a way for Leoman to get back into her good graces. Leoman says Heboric is partly right—Sha’ik was told that Bidithal was harming girls again, but wasn’t told anything about Felisin Younger. Furious, Heboric leaves. Karsa thinks he’ll go straight to Sha’ik, but Leoman says he won’t, not to Sha’ik.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Looking at the temple Bidithal now resides in, Heboric recalls how Bidithal had not always been a High Mage; he had once been the archpriest of the Cult of Rashan, a cult which long pre-dated Kellanved’s claiming of the Throne of Shadow. The cult hadn’t liked the ascension of Shadowthrone and Dancer and had “torn itself apart . . . blood had been spilled within temple walls . . . only those who acknowledged the mastery of the new gods remained among the devotees . . . the banished [such as Bidithal] slunk away.” Heboric believes the fact that the Rashan cult exiles found refuge with the Whirlwind is confirmation of his theory that the Whirlwind is a fragment of the shattered Shadow warren. Which makes him wonder whom Bidithal is loyal to. “The unknown player” he thinks, “the unseen current beneath the rebellion—indeed, beneath the Malazan Empire itself—was the new ruler of Shadow and his deadly companion . . . I now wonder, whose war is this!” Before he can enter Bidithal’s temple, L’oric steps out and warns Heboric that he just was with Bidithal and Bidithal is highly upset over something and short-tempered. L’oric confesses it might have been something he said to Bidithal that upset him. L’oric leaves and Heboric continues, passing Silgar who sits outside Bidithal’s tent, using one of his stumps to draw patterns in the dust, “surrounding himself in linked chains, round and round, each pass obscuring what had been made before.” Inside the tent, it appears Bidithal is talking in gestures with his shadow. He interrupts and Bidithal tells him to step closer; he wants to see if Heboric’s ghost hands have shadows. Heboric refuses and then brings up Bidithal’s “appetites.” Bidithal waves Heboric’s complaints off and Heboric tells him if he even looks at Felisin he’ll kill him. Bidithal says there are plenty of others and when Heboric says all of them are under the protection of Sha’ik and she will not permit it, Bidithal says perhaps Heboric should ask Sha’ik if that is so. He dismisses Heboric, but Heboric pauses, considering whether he should just kill Bidithal now and wondering how Sha’ik could allow him to do what he does. Bidithal warns Heboric that he has resanctified the temple. When Heboric asks if Bidithal really thinks Sha’ik will let him have a temple to Shadowthrone, Bidithal rages “that foreigner? The roots of Meanas are found in an elder warren. Once ruled by . . . Oh, not for you, ex-priest. There are purposes within the Whirlwind. . . Challenge me Ghost Hands and you will know holy wrath.” Heboric informs him he’s known such wrath before, then steps out of the tent. Silgar has gone, leaving behind “an elaborate pattern . . . Chains, surrounding a figure with stumps instead of hands, yet footed.” Heboric scuffs through the pattern as he leaves.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Karsa thinks how Heboric, despite his near-blindness, had “seen clearly enough those trailing ghosts, the wind-moaning train of deaths that stalked him [Karsa] day and night now, loud enough in Toblakai’s mind to drown out the voice of Urugal . . . mortal faces each and every one twisted with the agony and fear that had carved out the moment of dying . . . the children among those victims—children in terms of recently birthed as the lowlanders used the word—had not all fallen to the bloodsword . . . They were . . . the progeny that would never be, the bloodlines severed in the trophy-cluttered cavern of the Teblor’s history.” He wishes for solitude and peace but “the rattle of chains was unceasing, the echoing cries of the slain endless. The name he now goes by—”Toblakai, a name of past glories, of a race of warriors who had stood alongside mortal Imass, alongside coldmiened Jaghut and demonic Forkrul Assail”—he senses is full of “blinding irony,” and he vows vengeance on those who deceived his people, assisted them in their fall, though “the enemy had so many faces.” Karsa knows the Whirlwind is a lesser stepchild of the true power of Raraku itself and recalls how he knelt to Felisin as the reborn Sha’ik not out of faith but relief that he could drag Leoman from the spot where they had failed to protect the first Sha’ik. He knew Felisin was “but a hapless victim that the insane Whirlwind Goddess had simply plucked from the wilderness, a mortal tool that would be used with merciless brutality. That she had proved a willing participant in her own impending destruction was equally pathetic in Karsa’s eyes.” He thinks Felisin is similar to the old Karsa—the Karsa that led his two friends out to attack Silver Lake. Now he is witness to “the madness that was the soul of the Whirlwind Goddess seep[ing] out like poison in the blood to infect every leader among the rebellion.” He believes they rebel, though, not against the Malazan Empire, but against “sanity itself . . . Order. Honorable conduct. Rules of the common as Leoman called them.” Karsa knows that Leoman’s seemingly heavy use of durhang is a sham, that Leoman hasn’t ever actually used the drug but pretends to.</p><p>He believes Leoman is “biding his time,” as is Karsa, as is the desert itself: “Raraku waited with them. Perhaps, for them. The Holy Desert possessed a gift, yet it was one that few had ever recognized . . . a gift that would arrive unseen, unnoticed . . . too formless to grasp in the hands as one would a sword.” Leoman has been showing him the secrets of the desert, hidden springs, ancient sea-god temples, petrified remains of ships, fossils, ancient docks and piers, etc. He thinks how “Raraku had known Apocalypse first-hand, millennia past” and he wonders if it really wants to see it again, if the Whirlwind was really aligned with it: “did the goddess war with the desert?” In the grove he’s been walking to, he finds Felisin waiting for him. She says she wanders in the grove to think and says she’s concluded, “The gift of the goddess offers only destruction.” He tells her the grove and its stone will resist and she answers “for a while . . . but there remains that within me that urges creation.” When he suggests she have a baby she laughs. Pointing to the book of prophecies she is reading, she says “There are naught but bones in this tome . . . obsessed with the taking of life, the annihilation of order . . . not once does he [Dryjhna] offer anything in its stead. There is no rebirth among the ashes of his vision.” When she asks if this makes him sad, he brings her deeper into the grove and shows her a clearing ringed with petrified tree trunks, two of which he had carves into shapes of warriors (Bairoth and Delum). She asks if all the trunks will be warriors and he answers that the others will be different. She hears a snake and Karsa tells they always come to watch. She senses power and asks what it is, stating it isn’t the Whirlwind. Karsa agrees but says he doesn’t know what it is, perhaps he says it is the desert itself. Felisin says she thinks it’s actually Karsa’s own power. She asks how many carvings he will make and he says seven more, adding that these two were his friends, his only friends. He then points to them and says “creation.” She tells him she has “resurrected the habit” of writing poetry and he hopes it “serves her well.” She bridles a bit and answers “but that is never its purpose, is it. To serve. Or to yield satisfaction—self-satisfaction . . . the drive to create is something other, isn’t it?” He tells her the answer can only be found “in the search—and searching is at creation’s heart.” When she asks what he was searching for when he carved his friends, he says he doesn’t know, to which she responds, “Perhaps they will tell you, one day.” She thanks him and adds she is “humbled and revived.” He tells her the camp is troubled and she says she knows. As they work their way slowly through the many snakes now surrounding them, she says she should be “alarmed by all this,” and he thinks to himself “it is the least of your worries,” but only says he will keep her updated. She leaves. He turns to begin carving.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Heboric sits alone in his tent, dreading the nightly visions that come of “a face of jade, so massive it challenged comprehension. Power both alien and earthly, as if born of a natural force never meant to be altered. Yet altered it had been, shaped, cursed sentient. A giant buried in otataral, held motionless in an eternal prison.” He wonders who abandoned whom—he Fener or Fener him. He feels sure that someday he’ll have to return to the giant, though he doesn’t know what for. He thinks how he’d always thought Fener had taken his hands “into keeping, to await the harsh justice that was the Tusked One’s right,” but now that Fener had been dragged into this world, “Heboric’s severed hands had found a new master, a master possessed of such immense power that it could war with otataral itself. Yet it did not belong. The giant . . . was an intruder, sent here from another realm for a hidden purpose. And instead of completing that purpose, someone had imprisoned it.” He drinks more hen’bara tea, hoping it will narcotize him and keep the dream visions away. Felisin Younger appears and tells him her mother is calling a counsel. The confusing trip to Sha’ik’s tent reminds him of being led by Baudin out of the mines. He thinks “Tavore, you were not wrong to place your faith in him. It was Felisin who would not co-operate. You should have anticipated that . . . you should have anticipated a lot of things. But not this.” Inside the command tent/”Throne Room” are all the leaders save Leoman and Karsa, including Korbolo Dom, Kamist Reloe, Henaras (“a witch from some desert tribe that had for unknown reasons banished her.”), L’oric, Bidithal, Febryl, Fayelle, and Mathok. Felisin seems excited and she tells Heboric that “distant catastrophes have rocked the Malazan Empire . . . Less than a week [ago]. The warrens have been shaken, one and all, as if by an earthquake.” L’oric then announces, “the brutal reshaping of the pantheon . . . usurpation. Fener, Boar of Summer, has . . . been ousted as the preeminent god of war . . . In his place, the once First Hero Treach. The Tiger of Summer.” Heboric blames himself and Sha’ik and he share a glance of shared knowledge. Dom interrupts and says who cares, “War needs no gods, only mortal contestant . . . and whatever reasons they invent in order to justify killing each other.” When Sha’ik asks what his reasons are, he answers, “I like killing people. It is the one thing I am very good at.” Heboric asks if Dom is referring to “people in general” or does he mean just the Whirlwind’s enemies and Dom simply replies, “As you say.” L’oric continues with the news, telling them that the Beast Throne was taken by Togg and Fanderay and adds “I would suggest personally to those Soletaken and D’ivers among us ‘ware the new occupants . . . They may well come to you eventually to demand that you kneel before them.'” He then laughs about “the poor fools who followed the Path of the Hand,” at which Fayelle says “We were the victims . . . of deception. By minions of Shadowthrone,” and she vows vengeance. L’oric then informs them that Dujek’s army allied with Brood and Rake and Darujhistan to fight the Pannion Domin. He notes how this had been a matter of concern as a Genebackan peace would free Dujek’s Host to work with Tavore to deal with the Rebellion. Dom interrupts to say Tavore isn’t a concern, but Dujek is another matter, especially as Dujek owns his men “body and soul.” “Barring a few spies,” Sha’ik mentions “flatly.” Felisin Younger points out that Dujek had been outlawed, but L’oric says it was just a ruse. As Dom starts to tick off all the bad things about Dujek’s army coming to Seven Cities, L’oric says not to worry, “The Pannion War proved devastating. [The Host] lost close to seven thousand . . . The Black Moranth were similarly mauled. They won in the end but at such a cost. The Bridgeburners gone. Whiskeyjack dead . . . And Dujek himself a broken man . . . the scourge that is the T’lan Imass is no more. They have departed . . . Thus, what has the Empress left? Adjunct Tavore.” Dom starts to celebrate the news and Reloe asks about Quick Ben. L’oric tells them Ben is alive, as is Kalam. He adds a handful of Bridgeburners survived but were listed as casualties on purpose by Dujek. Reloe asks who and L’oric asks if it really matters since they are so few. When Reloe says yes, L’oric asks Sha’ik for permission to contact his spy and she gives it. Meanwhile, she tells her counselors that the Rebellion will deal the “killing blow” to the Empire. But Heboric hears “the hollowness of her words. Sister Tavore stands alone now. And alone is what she prefers. Alone is the state in which she thrives . . . [Felisin], your fear of sister Tavore has only deepened. Freezing you in place.” L’oric starts to list the survivors and at Paran’s name Sha’ik pales in shock. L’oric adds Quick Ben has been made High Mage, the Bridgeburners seem to have gone to Darujhistan though it isn’t definite, Moon’s Spawn was abandoned and became the tomb of Whiskeyjack and the others. He finishes by saying Whiskeyjack was killed by one of Brood’s commanders. Reloe worries about Quick Ben and the remaining Host but L’oric says the army is broken, “hence the wavering souls among them who sought me out.” Reloe asks about Kalam and Dom says the assassin “is nothing without Quick Ben . . . Even less now that his beloved Whiskeyjack is dead.” Kamist, seemingly terrified, asks what happens if the two of them reunite? Dom says he and Reloe weren’t the ones who killed Whiskeyjack; Quick Ben and Kalam will focus on vengeance for that. Sha’ik abruptly orders everyone out except for Heboric. When they leave, she breaks down, sobbing “My brother lives.” She goes into Heboric’s arm and he holds her, “the child in his arms—for child she was, once more—cried in nothing other than the throes of salvation. She was no longer alone, no longer alone with only her hated sister to taint the family’s blood.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER EIGHT</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Tavore is reviewing an assembly of the 14th Army, which isn’t going well. Gamet’s legion arrived late and disordered while the other two legions wait. Nok, meanwhile, has sailed with the fleet. Cuttle arrives with a dozen others, all looking pretty ragged in mismatched armor, and he explains they were in jail and he himself had killed an Untan noble called Lenestro. He tells Gamet he can get the legion under control. Gamet begins to lead him to where Tavore stands, just after Fiddler frees himself of the mob and heads toward her as well. Fiddle and Cuttle (both of whom are unknown to Gamet) make eye contact then communicate via gestures. Cuttle tells Fiddler to “draw us a line” and as Fiddler does that, Cuttle extracts munitions from his bag, telling Gamet and Tavore to withdraw some distance and to warn the Wickans to get off and hold their horses. Tavore begins to object but Cuttle interrupts and tells her to move. Fiddler and Cuttle discuss munitions placement as Gamet shakes his head thinking “sappers.”</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>The explosion gets the legion’s attention (as well as knocking a third down) and Cuttle and Fiddler gets them in order. Gamet asks if Cuttle’s dead nobleman was on the Chain of Dogs. Cuttle says ye and he was too until he was wounded and put on the Silanda. He said he would have preferred to have killed Pullyk Alar, but he’s run off with Mallick Rel, whom he’d also like to kill. Gamet offers him a command position, but Cuttle says he’s assigned to Fiddler’s squad (he calls him Strings) and prefers to stay there. Gamet asks how he know Fiddler and Cuttle, obviously lying, tells him he’s never met him before.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>After reviewing the now ordered 8th legion, Tavore tells Baralta and Blistig to send their legions in a company at a time. She’s interrupted when the 8th suddenly goes quiet, reacting to the appearance of Gamet’s toddler son Grub appears and walks to the exact spot where Tavore had just been reviewing the soldiers. Grub sees Keneb and raises his arms, revealing that he is holding a human bone. Keneb picks him up and explains to Tavore Grub was given him by Duiker, an orphan of the Chain of Dogs. He apologizes and she murmurs, “It is far too late for that.” Gamet thinks she is right: “Soldiers—even recruits—recognized an omen when it arrived. A child in the very boot prints of the woman who would lead this army. Raising high a sun-bleached thighbone. Gods below.”</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Fiddler calls a meeting of veterans, including Stormy, Gesler, and Cuttle. They are all depressed: There was no doubt among them concerning the meaning of the omen and Strings was inclined to agree. A child leads us to our deaths. A leg bone to signify our march, withered under the curse of the desert sun . . . this army of recruits now see themselves as already dead.” Fiddler tells them of a similar situation years ago when Nok commanded a half-dozen ships. They were going to meet pirate ships blessed by priests of D’rek, the Worm of Autumn. Nok’s fleet drew water at a river and sailed on with the barrels stored. When they opened the first, a paralt snake came out and bit the sailor that opened the barrel, killing him. Nok “shrugged the whole event off” and then, when he’d heard sailors and marines were dying of thirst because nobody wanted to open the other barrels, he ordered one brought up and opened it himself. It was full of snakes, as were all the others. The fleet never met the pirates and returned with half the crew dead. They sank all the ships in the harbor as an offering to D’rek. Nok had to wait another year to deal with the pirates. Fiddler tells them that was a story of how not to deal with this sort of thing: “You don’t destroy an omen by fighting it. No, you do the opposite. You swallow it whole.” He tells them he’d heard of a nearby cemetery “blown clear, the bones exposed to all” and tells them that’s where they’re heading.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Tavore addresses a meeting of commanders and tells them they march in two days. Gamet thinks to himself they should just disband the 14th; it’s useless after Grub’s action. Tavore tells them, as if she knew what Gamet was thinking, they can’t afford not to march; even if they are “annihilated” at least they’ll reduce Sha’ik’s army. She tells them to tell the officers she’ll be visiting each company tonight, restrict all men to barracks, have the Red Blades confiscate all alcohol, durhang, and the like. She dismisses them and calls for T’amber. Gamet thinks mentioning T’amber publically was a mistake, “That perfumed lover of yours has been kept from the sights of everyone here but me. They know of course. Even so.”</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Blistig pulls Gamet and Baralta aside and tells Gamet Tavore is crazy: “We cannot march at all. There will be a mutiny at worst, at best an endless bleeding of desertions. The Fourteenth is finished.” Gamet asks if Blistig and Keneb set up the scene with Grub. Baralta stops Blistig from drawing his sword in indignation, but also tells Blistig he had wondered the same. Blistig says Keneb would never do such a thing. Gamet tells them Tavore asked for two days and when Blistig objects that it was an order, Gamet tells him he wasn’t paying attention: “The Adjunct, young and untested as she is, is not a fool. She sees what you see—what we all see. But she has asked for two days . . . Trust her.” They other two agree. Baralta asks about T’amber: “Why is the Adjunct being so cagey? Women who take women for lovers—the only crime is the loss to men and so it has always been.” Gamet tells him Tavore isn’t being cagey, just private. Baralta wants to know what T’amber is like and if she has “undue influence” and Gamet replies he has no idea. He says he thinks she was a concubine in the Grand Temple of the Queen of Dreams back on Unta, but he’s hardly spoken to her. Before leaving, he tells Blistig he no longer suspects him.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Lostara Yil finishes stowing her Red Blade equipment. She had enjoyed being a Red Blade. She recalls growing up on the streets of Ehrlitan—”It had been common practice—before the Malazans came with their laws for families—among many tribes to cast out their unwanted children once they reached the fifth year of life.” Many were taken up by various temples and cults, though nobody knew what happened next with those children. She was rounded up at seven by the Rashan cult, where she spent two years doing menial labor, then was selected to be taught Shadow Dancing:</p><p>You are nothing child. Not a dancer. Your body is in service to Rashan, and Rashan is this realm’s manifestation of Shadow, the drawing of darkness to light. When you dance, it is not you that is watched. IT is the shadow your body paints. The shadow is the dancer, Lostara Yil, not you.” Meanwhile, the Malazan Empire came and purged many Seven Cities cults, but not Rashan, “for it was a recognized religion.” She remembers the night the cult was destroyed.</p><p>A High Priest from another city was visiting. Come to speak with Master Bidithal . . . There would be a dance . . . She remembered the stranger . . . Tall, thin, a laughing face, remarkably long-fingered, almost effeminate hands—hands the sight of which awakened in her new emotions . . . that stuttered her mechanical dancing.” Bidithal grew angry she had tainted the dance, drawn attention to herself, but the stranger’s “eyes held Lostara, in fullest recognition of the desire that overwhelmed her . . . Recognition and a certain pleased, but cool acknowledgment. As if flattered, but with no invitation offered in return . . . Of course, Delat had not come to steal the heart of a Caster. He had come to destroy Rashan. Delat, who it proved, was both a High Priest and a Bridgeburner, and whatever the Emperor’s reason for annihilating the cult, his was the hand that delivered the deathblow. Although not alone. The night of the killings . . . there had been another . . . an assassin . . . Lostara had been the only resident spared. OR so she believed for a long time, until the name of Bidithal rose once more.” And she thinks, “I was more than spared that night, wasn’t I? Delat’s lovely long-fingered hands.”</p><p>She joined the Red Blades—seen by the Seven Cities people as the “deliverers of Malazan justice” and she was fine with that as these people had betrayed her, had let be cast out at five, be dragged away by Bidithal at seven. She wonders if she now is a betrayer, and wonders as well what caused the Talons to turn against the Empire. “Betrayal was a mystery. Inexplicable to Lostara. She only knew that it delivered the deepest wounds of all.” Cotillion suddenly appears in her room. He tells her he was there that night in Ehrlitan: I was witness to your unexpected performance. Did you know Delat—or rather, the man I would eventually learn was Delat—would have taken you for his own? Not just he one night. You would have joined him as a Bridgeburner, and that would well have pleased him. Or so I believe. No way to test it, alas, since it all went—outwardly—so thoroughly awry . . . Delat, who had a different name for that mission and was my partner’s responsibility besides—Delat let Bidithal go. I suppose it seemed a betrayal, yes? It certainly did to my partner . . . who was not Shadowthrone then, simply a particularly adept and ambitious practitioner of Rashan’s sister warren, Meanas.” He introduces himself as both Cotillion and Dancer and implies a connection between that last name and what she was trained to do, telling her “it was never meant for performance, Lostara. It was, in fact, an art most martial. Assassination.” He calls upon her loyalty to the Empire and she assumes he’s going to say Laseen shouldn’t be the ruler. He, though, replies Laseen is “welcome to it . . . but she could do with some help.” Lostara responds “She supposedly assassinated you . . . She betrayed you.” But Cotillion shrugs it off, saying, “everyone had their appointed tasks. The game being played here is far larger than any mortal empire. Btu the empire . . . its success is crucial to what we seek . . . and the Empress sits on a tottering throne.” When she asks didn’t Cotillion betray Shadowthrone, he tells her “sometimes I see further than my dear companion. Indeed, he remains obsessed with desires to see Laseen suffer—I have other ideas, and while he may see them as party to his own, there is yet no pressing need to disabuse him of that notion . . . I admit to having made grave errors, indeed to knowing the poison of suspicion. Quick Ben. Kalam. Whiskeyjack. Where did their loyalty truly reside? Well, I eventually got my answer but I am not yet decided whether it pleases me or troubles me. There is one danger that plagues ascendants in particular, and that is the tendency to wait too long . . . I would make amends for past, at times fatal, hesitation.” He tells her he’d rather she doesn’t tell Pearl. She asks where Delat is and he answers “I have no hold over him these days . . . He is too powerful. Too mysterious. Too conniving. Too Hood-damned smart . . . Sometimes one must simply trust in fate, Lostara. The future can ever promise but one thing and one thing only: surprises. Btu know this, we would all save the Malazan Empire in our own ways.” She asks if he’s making her a Talon and when he says they no longer exists, she angrily tell shim not to play her for a fool. He reiterates that Surly destroyed them and asks if she has knowledge otherwise and she says she just assumed. She asks what he wants her to do.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Later, Pearl enters and says he senses magic. She tells him she was doing the Shadow Dance moves—keeps her flexible for fighting—and they can sometimes evoke Rashan. He tells her she should avoid that so as not to draw attention.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Pearl and Lostara go to question Gesler, Stormy, and Pella. They find Gesler in the barracks and Stormy asleep. Gesler tells Pearl if he wants to talk to Stormy, he can wake him up. Pearl rips the covers off Stormy, who grabs Pearl and throws him across the room. When he advances on Pearl, Gesler says let him be, he’s a Claw and Lostara is a Red Blade. Lostara tells them Pearl wants to hear their story and then asks where Pella is. She’s told out back and she goes to talk to him, finding him drilling holes into lots of small bones. She asks about his time as guard in the mines and as she tries to be discrete, he figures out she’s asking about Tavore’s sister Felisin: “I was wondering when somebody would find me about that. Am I under arrest?” When she asks why he would be, he answers he helped them escape the night of the Uprising—she and Baudin and Heboric. He describes them and their plan but he doesn’t know if they ever made it to a rendezvous on the other side of the island, but Truth might. She notes that Truth has the same strange skin as Gesler and Stormy and then asks about Felisin’s group. He tells her Kulp, sent by Duiker, was involved in order to help Heboric. Pella warns her against slandering Duiker: “This is Aren after all. The city that watched. That saw Duiker delivering the refugees to safety. He was the last one through the gate they say.” She tells him she knows, that Blistig had freed them from jail but after Pormqual led his army out. She has no interest she says in besmirching Duiker or his freeing of Heboric; she’s interested in Felisin. Truth figures she was sent by Tavore and he and Pella say they’ll keep it secret. Truth, though, says they’re all dead; Gesler is just telling Pearl that. Pella gives her one of the bones before she leaves and tells her to wear it prominently, but not why. She and Pearl leave and Pearl says he needs a handler—that Stormy was unnaturally strong and that there is something strange about all three: Stormy, Gesler, and Truth. He adds Gesler merely assumes Felisin’s group died; he doesn’t actually know. He plans to check out the Silanda. He also tells her Stormy was lucky she stepped between him and Pearl and she says Pearl obviously missed the T’lan Imass sword—that “probably weights as much as I do”—under Stormy’s bed, which shuts him up. At the Silanda, Pearl tells her most of the wood is from Drift Avalii, a drifting island filled not with “demons and spectres” as Lostara says is rumored, but with “hardly anything so frightening.” He uncovers a pile of severed heads, mostly Tiste Andii, and tells Lostara the ship is filled with layers and layers of magic: Kurald Galain, Telann, Kurald Emurlahn, Rashan.” Inside he finds the Tiste Edur killed by Karsa and otataral dust on the floor. He tells her Felisin was there and wonders who killed the Edur and what happened to the whistle that animates the rowers. He tells her they’re going to head for where Felisin’s group may have left the Silanda as it journeyed through warrens—across the mainland from the Otataral Sea to Aren Bay. Lostara says they may have ended up in the middle of the rebellion and Pearl says that may have seemed a good thing compared to what they’d been through.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>The army forms for Tavore’s review. Ranal notes the bones everyone is wearing and blames Fiddler for it, saying he’ll tell the Adjunct that when she wonders who “is responsible for this last spit in her face over what happened yesterday.” Fiddler calls him an idiot. Eyeing Keneb, Fiddler thinks of what he’d heard of how he’d ended up in Aren and wonders if Keneb is a coward who ran. He’s surprised when Tavore points to something around Keneb’s neck and he realizes Keneb’s wearing a bone. Tavore asks Ranal about the bones and he tells her it’s against his orders. She interrupts and tells him to make them more standardized in how they are worn and that the looted graveyards should be returned to their former state as much as possible. She adds he should get one himself. Fiddler thinks “oh well done lass.”</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>Gamet thinks whoever came up with the bone idea deserved a kiss: “they’ve turned the omen. Turned it!” He notes the “rekindled fire in Tavore’s eyes” as she orders him to make a standard inspired by the bones. He agrees. A messenger arrives and informs Tavore 300 Wickans with horses and dogs have arrived as volunteers: “Clan of the Crow. The Crow! Coltaine’s own!”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Nine</strong></p><p>Scene 1</p><p>Kalam is shopping at a G’danisban shop selling decks, weapons, other items, some clearly looted from tombs, some blessed by gods. The shopkeeper tells him the Decks are in flux due to a new House. When Kalam scoffs it’s probably just some fake cult, the keeper says he believes it’s a real House because “for, a new Unaligned card, a card denoting that a Master now commands the Deck. An arbiter, yes? And then . . . the new House. Sanctioned? Undecided. But not rejected out of hand . . . And the Readers—the patterns. The House will be sanctioned—not one Reader doubts that.” Kalam asks the about the House’s name and ruler and the shopkeeper tells him it is the House of Chains, but as for who rules it or what throne, “there is naught but confusion . . . Ascendants vie. But . . . the Throne where the King will sit—the Throne, my friend, is cracked.” Kalam asks if he means the Chained One and the keeper confirms the House belongs to the Crippled God. When Kalam muses that “the others must be assailing it fiercely,” the show owner replies “You would think, but not so. Indeed, it is they who are assailed.” The owner shows Kalam a pair of Wickan knives—”booty from the Chain of Dogs.” One of them is “alloyed with otataral” and the other invested with Elder magic impressed with a serpent’s tail and Kalam recognizes the stamp: “Fenn. Thelomen Toblakai . . I know that mark. I know precisely who invested this weapon [Bellurdan].” Kalam buys the weapons with diamonds from Cotillion and the shopkeeper recognizes their Shadow. The shop owner tells him of a group of several hundred Malazans besieged in a nearby fortress—B’ridys—though he imagines they’re almost finished. As Kalam walks away, he thinks, “You damned fool, Cotillion. You were there at the last Chaining, weren’t you? You should have stuck a knife in the bastard right then and there.”</p><p>Scene 2</p><p>Kalam walks on the road toward B’ridys thinking the Malazans there were probably starving. Looking ahead, he assumes the known water sources have been fouled in preparation of Tavore’s army approaching, though he’s not worried, as he knows several secret sources. He realizes Sha’ik “had drawn the Whirlwind close, a tactic that suggested to the assassin a certain element of fear” or perhaps the makings of a trap, leading Tavore into the heart of Raraku which Sha’ik’s forces knew better. Though Kalam knows of “at least one man in Tavore’s army who knows Raraku. And he’d damn well better speak up when the time comes.</p><p>Scene 3</p><p>Kalam arrives at the besieging camp mid-morning and notes a lack of sharpness among the besiegers, as well as a note of impatience as they prepare for a final assault, apparently coming tomorrow. The besiegers are mostly former Malazan soldiers from Seven Cities. As Kalam moves toward the lieutenant seemingly in charge, he observes his uniform labels him Ashok Regiment and he thinks “Stationed in Genabaris a few years past. Then sent back to Ehrlitan . . . I’d have thought they would have stayed loyal.” The lieutenant introduces himself as Captain Irriz and Kalam wonders if he felt “underappreciated in the regiment,” based on his self-promotion. The captain says a mage just arrived who says she can blow a big hole in the easy-to-defend balcony entrance. She arrives—young, Malazan—and tells Kalam to keep his otataral knife away from her. Greed flashes through Irriz’s eyes as he asks Kalam where he got it; Kalam tell him form the Wickan he killed on the Chain of Dogs. The besiegers pray and voice blessings on the Chain of Dogs. Irriz demands to know why Kalam isn’t with Sha’ik and wonders why Korbolo Dom would have let Kalam leave. Sinn—the mage—says, “Because Korbolo Dom is an idiot, and Kamist Reloe even worse. I am amazed he didn’t lose half his army after the Fall. What true soldier would stomach what happened there?” She asks Kalam if he deserted Dom’s Dogslayers and Kalam responds he went “looking for a cleaner fight. She mocks him for coming to B’ridys then and Kalam thinks to himself “her mind is broken” before saying out loud that he finds it “odd that you are here, seemingly so eager to kill fellow Malazans.” She tells him she has her own reasons then tells Irriz she wants to speak to him alone. Irriz tells Kalam they want to take the besieged alive “to give us sport. Punishment for being so stubborn. I especially want their commander [Captain Kindly].” He continues that he knew Kindly from the Ashok and “this is a personal argument for me . . . it’s why I want those bastards alive.” Sinn points out that Kalam’s knife can neutralize the Malazans’ mage and Kalam agrees to enter the breach first, thinking “first in, last out” before saying “It won’t be my first time sir.” As Sinn and Irriz leave, Kalam thinks “Captain Kindly. Never met you sir, but for years you’ve been known as the meanest officer in the entire Malazan military. And, it now seems, the most stubborn too. Excellent. I could use a man like that.”</p><p>Scene 4</p><p>He finds an empty tent to sleep in. When he wakes up at night, he approaches the fort but stops at the sight of sorcery around the base of the siege towers. He watches Sinn for a while, then moves toward her, getting her attention when his otataral blade interferes with her magic. He tells her it’s “a nasty nest of snakes for you to play in,” and she says she wasn’t sure which side Kalam was on and still isn’t. He says he was going to weaken the towers just as she’s done, but he wanted to keep one. He realizes how young she is. She tells him she’s only just learning magic and had been tutored by Fayelle “who slid her knife across the throats of my father and mother. Who went hunting for me too. But I slipped away.” She says this is the beginning of her revenge and she needs soldiers and one of Kindly’s sergeants is her half-brother, though she doesn’t know if he still lives. When Kalam says he’ll work with her she asks why, and he responds, “Fayelle is with Korbolo Dom, yes? Well, I have a meeting pending with Korbolo. And with Kamist Reloe. So we’ll work together in convincing Captain Kindly.” The relief in her voice makes him recall the thirteen hundred children he’d saved: “And there, in those faces, was the true horror of war. Those children had been alive when the carrion birds cam down for their eyes.” Sinn tells him she’s already taken care of Irriz and his warriors by poisoning their water with Tralb, which she thinks will just make them a bit sick and thus useless in the morning. When she tells Kalam how much she’d used and when, he realizes only a few guards had probably drunk it, but also that the amount would mean they’d die horribly. Kalam leaves her for a moment and kills the three guards as an act of mercy. As he thinks about staving in the water casks to prevent more poisonings, he sees three Malazans come down via rope from the fortress and realizes they’d been watching. The lead soldier asks Kalam who he is and just responds a soldier, then tells the soldier he needs the mage with them to empty the camp’s water casks due to the poison. When the soldier says he’d be fine with the besiegers dying that way, Kalam suggests he take it up with Captain Kindly. Another Malazan says they didn’t come down to deal with the besiegers but to retrieve Kalam. When Kalam wonders what for, he realizes the soldiers don’t look starved or parched. They tell him they can leave whenever they want by back tunnels but they’ve got nowhere to go as the “whole land is out for Malazan blood,” saying they haven’t heard any news for a long time. Kalam says he’ll go with them, along with Sinn, if they empty the water casks. The Malazans say they want Irriz too and Kalam tells them he’ll bring him. He leaves to get Sinn, whom he finds dancing under the towers, “hands fluttering like capemoth wings.” He brings her to the Malazans and they take her with them as he turns back to the camp. He pulls out one of Cotillion’s diamonds and takes out a bone whistle that Cotillion had given him, telling him “Blow hard and you’ll awaken all of them. Blow soft and directly at one in particular and you’ll awaken that one alone.” Kalam uses the whistle and an Azalan demon arises, “From a territory in the Shadow Realm bordering that of the Aptorians.” Kalam thinks how to phrase his request—”Get Captain Irriz. Alive, but kept quiet. Join me at the rope”—especially as the demon possesses no language, but his thoughts are interrupted when the demon urinates and the stench drives Kalam out of the tent. The demon exits and disappears toward Irriz’s tent and Kalam realizes it must have read his mind. He sees smoke rising from where the demon had urinated and heads toward the rope hanging down the wall, reaching it as his tent bursts into flames. He hears shouts then screams, “each one ending in a strange mangled squeal.” As he climbs he’s passed by the demon, carrying Irriz. Kalam gets into the fortress just as the balcony collapses (the demon held it for him until he was safe). Kalam tells the Malazans his real name, which silences them. The mage—Ebron—says he thought Kalam and the others were outlawed and Kalam tells them it was a feint. They introduce themselves as Sergeant cord, Bell, and Corporal Shard—Sinn’s half-brother. Kalam asks about Kindly and Cord says they lost him and the lieutenant days ago when they fell down a well shaft and drowned, swept away by an underground river. Cord, saying he outranks Kalam, drafts him to join the Ashok Second Company—51 soldiers (including Limp, who broke his leg in a rock slide). When Kalam tells him he’s got news and alternatives to staying at B’ridys, Cord says when he wants advice he’ll let Kalam know and then says to get rid of the demon. Kalam informs him the demon just killed 500 besiegers in a few minutes and he can’t claim for surety it does what he wants. Cords asks if that’s a threat and Kalam tells him he’ll take Cord’s squad and even follow his orders “unless they happen to be idiotic” and if Cord has a problem with that he can bring it to Kalam’s sergeant Whiskeyjack because outside of the Empress, that’s the only person he answers to. Ebron guess Kalam is on a mission for the Empress, probably back with the Claw.</p><p>Scene 5</p><p>Cutter and Apsalar approach Drift Avalii as a storm nears. He’d told her of Cotillion’s visit and she’d been distressed and furious, seemingly that Cotillion had recruited Cutter. He realizes his thought that making Cotillion his patron would bring the two of them closer was an error and had been surprised to learn she wasn’t happy with the path she was on, didn’t find “pleasure or satisfaction from her own cold, brutal efficiency as a killer.” He’d thought competency alone would be reward, but Apsalar believed “competency was not justification.” When he mentions that Cotillion has said there’d be trouble on the island, she tells him the inhabitants are Tiste Andii—”Rake’s own—placed there to guard the Throne. She remembers a conversation Cotillion had with them and says, “These Tiste Andii have known isolation for far too long. Their master left them there, and has never returned . . . There are complications.” Trying to land, their boat is wrecked and Cutter gets yanked down by a current under the island then spat out into an underground pool but he’s too weak to pull himself up out of the water. He’s saved by an old Tiste Andii who calls himself Darist. He tells Cutter he was the only one in the pool and that Apsalar probably drowned, adding they need to leave quickly because “the very presence of life in this place risks his awakening.” Cutter asks whose awakening but Darist doesn’t answer. They take stairs up into a hall (still below ground) and Darist tells him the island is under attack. When Cutter asks about the Throne, Darist wonders what brought him to the island. Cutter replies he was sent by a mage, Baruk of Darujhistan, whose studies had made him think the island and Throne were at risk. Cutter guesses the Tiste Edur have returned to try and retake the Throne of Shadow and mentions Rake. Darist interrupts and says if Rake isn’t happy with how they’ve protected the Throne he should come himself. He then guesses Cutter lied about Baruk sending him and demands if it was Rake who did so, also asking if Rake “renews his claims to the blood of the Tiste Andii? Has he renounced his Draconian blood?” When Cutter says he doesn’t know, Darist asks if Rake looks as old as he does, then assumes based on Cutter’s facial reaction Rake does not and starts to tell Cutter what he can say to Rake when he returns to him. Cutter tells him he wasn’t sent by Rake and doesn’t know him, only saw him in passing while Rake was fighting a demon. Darist stops talking and moves on. Cutter realizes he should have thought more about what Cotillion would do with the knowledge Cutter brought him of the island and thinks his old self—Crokus—would have asked more questions. He believes “This new persona was imposing a certain sense of stricture—he’d though it would bring him more freedom. But now it was beginning to appear that the truly free one had been Crokus.” Cutter asks again about Apsalar and Darist answers that above them they can sense Tiste Edur and no one else. When Cutter feels sick at the thought, Darist tells him “Death is not an unkind fate . . . you will miss her company, and that is the true source of grief—your sorrow is for yourself . . . I speak from experience. I have felt the deaths of many of my kin, and I mourn the spaces in my life where they once stood. But such losses serve only to ease my own impending demise.” Cutter calls Darist a “fool” and tells him to shut up. Cutter asks about the battle and Darist says they lost, there is only himself left here in the Hold where the Throne is. He warns Cutter to rest for they will soon have “company.”</p><p>Scene 6</p><p>Back in the Nascent, Onrack can hear the “howls of rage” coming from the spirits trapped inside two of the statues. Trull asks what Onrack knows of the Hounds of Shadow and he replies “Very little. The Logros crossed paths with them only once, long ago, in the time of the First Empire. Seven in number. Serving an unknown master, yet bent on destruction.” Trull questions is he means the human or Imass first Empire and Onrack says the Imass one; he doesn’t know much about the human one: “We were drawn into its heart but once . . . in answer to the chaos of the Soletaken and D’ivers. The Hounds made no appearance during that slaughter.” Looking at the statues, he relates how bonecasters believe “to create an icon of a spirit or god is to capture is essence within that icon . . . In this way power is chained, and so becomes manageable,” and asks if the Edur believe the same. Trull asks if he thinks the Edur made these statues and if his bonecasters “also believe that power begins as a thing devoid of shape, and thus beyond control? And that to carve out an icon—or make a circle of stone—actually forces order upon that power?” Onrack thinks then says, “It must be that we make our own gods and spirits. That belief demands shape, and shaping brings life into being. Yet were not the Tiste Edur fashioned by Mother Dark? Did not your goddess create you?” Trull says he doesn’t know of his kind make the statues, and “as for Mother Dark, it may be that in creating us, she but simply separated what was not separate before. When Onrack asks if he means that the Edur are Tiste Andii shadows, “torn free by the mercy of your goddess mother,” Trull responds, “we are all torn free.” Onrack notes that the statues cast no shadow and Trull informs him the Hounds don’t either, to which Onrack replies “If they are but reflections, then there must be Hounds of Darkness, from which they were torn . . .yet there is no knowledge of such.” When he turns abruptly silent, Trull laughs that Onrack clearly knows more about the human First Empire than he’d let on, and asks “what was that tyrant emperor’s name?” Onrack answers “Dessimbelackis . . . The founder of the human First Empire. Long vanished by the time of the unleashing of the Beast Ritual. It was believed he had veered [into seven beasts].” Trull looks again at the statues and says he doubts that were built by Edur: “I feel no empathy. They are ominous and brutal to my eyes . . . The Hounds of Shadow are not worthy of worship. They are indeed untethered, wild and deadly. To truly command them, one must sit in the Throne of Shadow—as master of the realm. But more than that. One must first draw together the disparate fragments. Making Kurald Emurlahn whole once more.” Onrack points out Trull’s kin are trying to do just that, and adds the idea “distresses” him. Trull says he didn’t worry at first, but cam to see that “another power acts behind the veil in all this” and he would learn what it is because “it has made of my people an abomination.” Trull continues to say Onrack doesn’t know what it’s like to “see your kin fall into dissolution, to see the spirit of an entire people grow corrupt, to struggle endlessly to open their eyes.” Onrack replies “true “before Trull continues: “Nor is it mere naiveté . . . Our denial is willful, our studied indifference conveniently self-serving to our basest desires. We are a long-lived people who now kneel before short-term interests.” Onrack interrupts to comment that “if you find that unusual, . . . the one behind the veil has need for you only in the short term” and points out that such a power would either discard its pawns if they were merely useless or annihilate them if they posed a threat. Trull agrees, then changes the subject and wonders why the two spirits of the Hounds are there. Onrack says “The stone has been shaped to encompass them . . . No one asks the spirit or the god, when the icon is fashioned, if it wishes entrapment. Do they? The need to make such vessels is a mortal’s need. That one can rest yes on the thing one worships is an assertion of control at worst, or at best the illusion that one can negotiate over one’s fate.” When Trull asks if Onrack finds such notions pathetic, Onrack answers “I find most notions pathetic.” Trull asks him if he thinks they’re trapped for eternity, if this is where they go when destroyed and Onrack gets frustrated, saying, “you possess your own knowledge and suspicions yet would not speak them. Instead, you seek to discover what I know . . . I care nothing for the fate either way of these Hounds of Shadow” and he bemoans that apparently there are only five left alive because it decreases his chance of killing one. Trull laughs and says he doesn’t think Onrack would walk away from such an encounter. Onrack breaks one of the pillars and it explodes, followed quickly by the second one. The Hound is as tall at its shoulders as Trull is and it casts shadow below it. The two Hounds attack and one throws Onrack to the other, who catches him and shatters his left arm, tearing it from his body, before tossing him to the ground where he can’t move. The attack ripped the Vow from him; “He was now, he realized, as those of his fallen kin, the ones that had sustained so much physical destruction that they had ceased to be one with the T’lan Imass.” The Hounds leave and Trull stands over Onrack and tells him “I do not know if you can hear me . . . But . . . those were not Hounds of Shadow. Oh no, indeed. They were the real ones. The Hounds of Darkness, my friend. I dread to think what you have freed here.” Onrack replies, “so much for gratitude.</p><p>Scene 7</p><p>Onrack tells Trull “if my kin were present they would complete the necessary rites. They would sever my head from my body, and find for it a suitable place so that I might look out upon eternity. They would dismember the headless corpse and scatter the limbs. They would take my weapon, to return it to the place of my birth.” He adds since Trull can’t do any of that, he’s forced to continue on. He stands and retrieves his sword. Trull asks Onrack, if his kind had been there, would they have done all Onrack had mentioned even though Onrack could still move. Onrack says he is, like Trull, “shorn.” He is shorn from the Ritual and from his fellow T’lan Imass: “My existence is now without meaning. The final task left to me is to seek our the other hunters, to do what must be done.” They walk through the city. The reach a bridge and at the near end they find a box of Moranth munitions, which Onrack explains to Trull. They head toward an arch—the portal they’ve been seeking. It’s emitting a lot of heat, which they assume is a ward. Onrack thinks the munitions might shatter the ward. They toss a munition and it breaks the ward, revealing the warren. Trull senses something coming and Onrack tells him to flee: “He could feel the power of the ones on the other side of the gate, a power brutal and alien. The breaking of the ward had been noted, and the emotion reaching through the barrier was one of indignant outrage.” Trull runs across the bridge and out of sight as Onrack slowly backs up, ready to purchase time for Trull with his life. Four riders on white horses come through the gate: tall, pale, wearing enamel armor, wielding curved scimitars. As they try to ride down Onrack, he wounds one of them but his body takes a terrible toll, losing bone shards and the side of his face. The four wheel around to face him and one asks him if he “can understand the Language of Purity.” When Onrack says it seem no more pure than any other, the other responds “We do not forgive ignorance. You are a servant of Death. There is but one necessity when dealing with a creature such as you, and that is annihilation.” But the wounded one (called seneschal Jorrude by the others) interrupts (calling the other Enias), saying Onrack is not “one of the trespassers we seek . . . none of them are here.” He adds he needs healing and asks another one, Orenas, to help him. He says Onrack might have answers and if they want, they can kill him later. Enias asks Onrack what sorcery holds him together and when Onrack mentions he seems to be of Tiste blood, he says “Only among the Liosan is the Tiste blood pure. You have crossed paths with our tainted cousins, then. They are little more than vermin.” When Onrack starts to say what he knows about the Tiste Andii, including they were the first, Enias interrupts with “The first! . . . and so tragically imperfect. Bereft of Father Light’s purifying blood. They are a most sordid creation. We tolerate the Edur, for they contain something of the Father, but the Andii—death by our hands is the only mercy they deserve.” Onrack replies “My kind has much experience with arrogant creatures. Although that experience is singular: in answer to their arrogance we proclaimed eternal war, until they ceased to exist. I have always believed the T’lan Imass should seek out a new enemy. There is, after all, no shortage to be noted among arrogant being. Perhaps you Tiste Liosan are numerous enough in your own realm to amuse us for a time.” Malachar, Enias’ brother, tells him Onrack is an example of the “lesser races” and their lies that he’s been warning Enias about. Malachar and Enias exchange words, then Jorrude tells Onrack if he doesn’t answer their questions they’ll destroy him. The four Liosan and Onrack draw swords, but before they fight Trull appears at the end of the bridge and tells Onrack he is sorry, but he’s brought assistance. Four T’lan Imass swirl up next to Trull. Onrack identifies Monok Ochem and Ibra Gholan and tells them he is the sole survivor of the flood from his group of Imass hunting the rebels. Monok says Onrack has “failed the Ritual” and so needs to be destroyed, but Onrack tells him the “that privilege will be contested” as the Liosan claim him as their prisoner. Three of the Imass approach and Jorrude says the Liosan are happy to give them Onrack; they have no quarrel with the Imass. Jorrude then asks if Trull wants to go with them, saying “we have need of a servant.” Trull says no and suggests they rotate the role amongst them. Jorrude tells his brothers it’s time to go, but Monok says they won’t find it very easy: “This warren is a shattered fragment of Kurald Emurlahn . . . your kind have remained isolated for far too long. You know nothing of the other realms, nothing of the Wounded Gates. Nothing of the Ascendants and their wars.” Jorrude interrupts to say they serve only one Ascendant—Osric, Father Light’s son. Monok asks when Osric last walked among them, then informs them he is one of the “contestants in the other realms. He has not returned to you because the is unable to do so. Indeed, he is unable to do much of anything at the moment . . . He is lost.” This is news to the Liosan, but before they can continue the conversation, Monok suggests they all work together in a ritual to make a gate, using Telann, Liosan, and the Edur’s blood. When Trull asks what that was about needing his blood, and Monok replies “Not all of it, Edur. If all goes as planned.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Ten</strong></p><p>Scene 1</p><p>Karsa wishes Bairoth were still alive to help him with his carvings of the seven Teblor “gods;” he feels “something essential was missing from the seven faces had had carved . . . though that did not seem the case with the carvings of Bairoth and Delum. The energy of their lives seemed to emanate from their statues . . . as with the entire forest, in which there was the sense that the trees but awaited the coming of spring, of rebirth . . . it seemed that the two Teblor warriors were but awaiting the season’s turn.” As he faces Urugal’s statue, he feels the grove is no longer a refuge for “he had brought is own life to this place, the legacies of his deeds.” He thinks also how Raraku gives a false illusion that time stands still, but outside armies are marching and his people are under siege. Leoman arrives and asks what the seven statues are (he recognizes the other two as Toblakai). When Karsa says “my gods,” Leoman is shocked. Karsa adds some explanation and then says his gods still call him, haunt him. Leoman asks what they’re demanding of Karsa. Karsa doesn’t answer and Leoman tells him he came because of news about the Malazans. Leoman believes Tavore’s march should be contested, but not by big battles as Dom desires. Sha’ik has given permission for Leoman to ride out with a company, and when Karsa rightly assumes the permission is to scout only rather than harass/attack, Leoman says once he’s out, he’ll do what he wants. Karsa warns him Sha’ik will know and Leoman shrugs. When Leoman starts to complain about her, Karsa answers that she is Malazan. Leoman argues she was reborn and “became the will of the Goddess,” so her past doesn’t matter, but Karsa says it does: “It is those memories that chain her so. She is trapped by fear, and that fear is born of a secret which she will not share. The only other person who knows that secret is Ghost Hands.” When Leoman says Karsa sounds defeatist, Karsa shrugs and said he’s had good years: “Your company, Leoman. Sha’ik Elder. I once vowed that the Malazans were my enemies. Yet, from what I now have seen of the world since that time, I now understand that they are no crueler than any other lowlander. Indeed, they alone seem to profess a sense of justice. The people of the Seven Cities—who so despise them and wish them gone—they seek nothing more than the power that the Malazans too from them. Power that they used to terrorize their own people. Leoman, you and your kind make war against justice, and it is not my war.” Leoman says he won’t disagree, perhaps he has “seen too much” and that is why there is, as Sha’ik says “no loyalty” in him. He asks Karsa if he’s ever wondered then why Leoman has stayed and he answers his own question: “The Apocalyptic, Toblakai. Disintegration. Annihilation. Everything. Every human, lowlander. With our twisted horrors—all that we commit upon each other. The depredations, the cruelties. For every gesture of kindness and compassion there are ten thousand acts of brutality. Loyalty? I have none. Nor for my kind, and the sooner we obliterate ourselves the better this world will be.” Karsa, though, is paying attention to his carvings and thinks he’s figured out it is the light causing the problem; the light “makes them look almost human.” Leoman struggles to not say anything.</p><p>Scene 2</p><p>Heboric, L’oric, Sha’ik, Febryl, Young Felisin, and Bidithal are looking at a Deck, specifically at cards of the House of Chains. Heboric senses flaws in each while L’oric senses great power. When he says it’s even greater than Shadow’s power at birth, Bidithal explodes: “Those deceivers could never unveil that realm’s true power . . . In this House, the theme is pure. Imperfection is celebrated, the twist of chaotic chance mars one and all.” Sha’ik tells him to shut up. Heboric wonders if this new House will be ally or enemy; he leans toward enemy, as—he thinks—does L’oric, while Bidithal seems to think it will be a “source for renewed strength.” Sha’ik asks again to see the new unaligned card and Bidithal puts it down, saying the idea that this person is a Master of the Deck is absurd. Sha’ik asks, yet again, if Heboric senses anything, and he tells her there is no link of power between his hands and the Deck. She tells him she isn’t asking because of his hands, but because of his past life as a priest and historian. She starts to describe the picture, noting his average height, a scar or blood running down one side of his face. She adds: “he stands on a bridge. Of stone, shot through with cracks. The horizon is filled with flames. It seem she and the bridge are surrounded, as if by followers or servants.” L’oric points out they could also be guardians, especially as they look like soldiers. Heboric asks what they soldiers are standing on and after wondering how Heboric knew there was something to see there, Sha’ik says “bones . . . Not human. Very large. Part of a skull is visible, long-snouted, terribly fanged. It bears the remnants of a helmet of some sort.” Heboric begins to rock, feeling a “sourceless keening in his head, a cry of grief, of anguish.” Sha’ik continues: “The Master . . . stands strangely. Arms held out, bent at the elbows so the hands descend, away from the body.” Heboric asks if his feet are together and she answers “almost impossibly so.” Heboric thinks to himself it is like the Master is “forming a point,” then asks what the figure is wearing. Sha’ik answers, “Tight silks . . .Black . . . a chain. It cuts across his torso, left shoulder down to right hip . . . black wrought iron. There are wooden discs on his shoulders—like epaulets . . . four.” From his questions and responses, Sha’ik and L’oric can tell Heboric knows something. Febryl asks him why the Master is standing as he does and Heboric replies, “Because he is a sword,” and then thinks: “but not any sword. He is one sword, above all, and it cuts cold. That sword is this man’s own nature. He will cleave his own path. None shall lead him. He stands now in my mind. I see him. I see his face. Oh, Sha’ik.” L’oric describes the figure as a “lodestone to order in opposition to the House of Chains,” but points out he stands alone, despite the possible guardians, while the House has many servants. Heboric says “Alone? He has always been thus.” L’oric asks why Heboric smiles like “a broken man” when he says that and Heboric refuses to answer, though he thinks, “I grieve for humanity. This family, so at war with itself.” Sha’ik says she will speak alone to Heboric, but he tells her he will say no more but “have faith in the Master of the Deck. He shall answer the House of Chains. He shall answer it.” He stands up to leave and Young Felisin guides him out. Outside, he can hear Dom’s army training and he thinks how militarily Tavore’s and Sha’ik’s armies will be evenly matched and trained, and that Tavore’s advantage in munitions will be answered with Sha’ik’s advantage in sorcery, as it appears Tavore has no mages save the “broken” Nil and Nether. He thinks Sha’ik might actually win. Younger Felisin tells Heboric he needs to leave the camp and “retrace your path, else what haunts you will kill you . . .. Something is contained within you. Trapped within your moral flesh. What will happen when your flesh fails?” He says his death may seal the portal, put things back as they were, but she answers it won’t happen: “It’s here—the power behind those ghostly hands of yours—not the otataral, which is fading . . . Have not your dreams and visions worsened? Have you not realized why? . . . An entire island of otataral was created to contain that statue, to hold it prisoner. But you have given it a mean to escape—there through your hands.” He asks if Sha’ik told Younger Felisin [hereafter referred to by me as just Felisin] about herself on that journey and when Felisin says it doesn’t matter, he says it does, but then stops before saying what he is thinking: “Because she is Malazan. Because she is Tavore’s sister! Because this war is no longer the Whirlwind’s—it has been stolen away, twisted by something far more powerful, by the ties of blood that bind us all in the harshest, tightest chains! What chance a raging goddess against that?” Felisin says she’ll go with him and he is horrified by the idea and its terribly perfect symmetry. She says she’ll find a warrior as well. He tells her say nothing to anybody, including Leoman, whom she’s considered asking.</p><p>Scene 3</p><p>Leoman asks if Karsa will come with him when he rides out and Karsa says there are no horses for him. Leoman says there are some to the west in the Jhag Odhan, wild horse once bred by Jaghut, that would fit him. He tells him how to get there, two weeks travel past Y’Ghatan, which is itself a ways away. He adds the nomadic Jaghut, who had fallen nearly into savagery due to predation, were all killed by the Logros T’lan Imass. Karsa says that is a name from the Teblor past and Leoman mutters “Closer than that.” He tells Karsa to ask Sha’ik leave to go and Karsa says he will, but that Leoman shouldn’t wait for him. He will join him if they are still in the field upon his return. Worried about Felisin, Karsa says he should kill Bidithal before going, but Leoman says he’s pretty sure Heboric will soon leave the camp and take Felisin with him, adding he’ll send someone with them and had actually been considering Karsa. Karsa says he will not travel with Heboric and Leoman replies that Heboric “holds truth for you, Toblakai. One day, you will need to seek him out. You might even need to ask for his help.” Karsa scoffs that he needs nobody’s help, then says he’ll leave tomorrow. Leoman mentions maybe all this will distract Sha’ik from the new House of Chains and Karsa says, “chains . . . I so dislike chains.” Leoman leaves and Karsa thinks “Chains. They haunted him, had haunted him ever since he and Bairoth and Delum rode out from the village. Perhaps even before then. Tribes fashioned their own chains after all. As did kinship, and companions, and stories with their lessons in honor and sacrifice. And chains as well between the Teblor and their seven gods. Between me and my gods. Chains again, there in my visions—the dead I have slain, the souls Ghost Hands says I drag behind me. I am—all that I am—has been shaped by such chains. This new House—is it mine?” The air grows suddenly cold and the snakes flee the grove. Karsa watches as Urugal’s face wakens and he hears in his mind “a thousand souls moaning, the snapping thunder of chains.” Urugal speaks, telling Karsa they have waited a long time for this fashioning of a sacred place and he complains of Karsa wasting time carving his two friends, demanding Karsa destroy them because of the sentimentality that taints the temple and because they offend the gods, all of who are now awake. Karsa warns Urugal that he is the one that brought them here, freed them of their prison in the Teblor land (pointing out he knows more than they think he does), and what he made he can shatter. The seven are angry and Urugal eventually says Karsa has brought them close enough so they can sense the location of what they desire and he orders Karsa to go there. Karsa asks what they want in that place and Urugal answers, “like you warrior, we seek freedom.” He tells Urugal he is to travel west into the Jhag Odhan and they are shocked and excited and want to know how he knows this. He doesn’t say it, but thinks “Because at last, I am my father’s son.” He tells them he will leave at dawn and find what they desire. They fade out and he knows they are not as powerful nor as close to freedom as they want him to think. He turns to face his friends, “those for whom this place had in truth been sanctified. By Karsa’s own hands. In the name of those chains a mortal could wear with pride.” He tells them “My loyalty was misplaced. I served only glory. Words my friends. And words can wear false nobility. Disguising brutal truths. The words of the past that so clothed the Teblor in a hero’s garb—this is what I served. While the true glory was before me. Beside me. You.” Bairoth’s statue speaks “Lead us Warleader.” He tells Karsa “WE have walked the empty lands . . . Empty, yet we were not alone. Strangers await us all Karsa Orlong. This is the truth they would hide from you. We are summoned. We are here.” Delum speaks and says “none can defeat you on this journey” and Bairoth asks who their enemy is now. Karsa answers, “Witness my answer my friends. Witness.” Delum says, “We failed you Karsa Orlong. Yet you invite us to walk with you once again.” Bairoth says the same, but Karsa replies, “It is I who failed you. I would be your warleader once more, if you would so permit me.” Bairoth says “At last, something to look forward to,” and Karsa thinks, “Dear Urugal, you shall witness. Oh, how you shall witness.”</p><p>Scene 4</p><p>L’oric enters Heboric’s tent as he is musing on death and dying, the ultimate journey for all mortals. L’oric says he is there to offer an exchange of knowledge that will stay between the two of them. Heboric asks why he should trust L’oric and says anyway, L’oric has nothing of interest to him: Febryl is a fool, Bidithal will be killed by a child he abuses, Dom and Reloe will be brought before the Empress and treated as criminals, and the Whirlwind Goddess gets nothing but contempt from him. L’oric, though, says he can tell Heboric of the Jade statue. Heboric says OK, but tomorrow because he is too tired. L’oric offers to make his tea for him and Heboric, struck by his kindness, asks L’oric to promise to be long gone form the camp when the final day arrives. L’oric says it’s a hard promise to make, but he’ll think about it. As he makes the tea, he ruminates on the warrens: “some of the oldest scholarly treatises on the warrens speak of a triumvirate. Rashan, Thyr, and Meanas. AS if the three were all closely related to one another. And then in turn seek to link them to corresponding Elder warrens . . . There certainly seems to be a mutual insinuation of themes between Darkness and Shadow, and, presumably, Light. A confusion among the three, yes. Anomander Rake himself has asserted a proprietary claim on the Throne of Shadow . . . set kin to guard it, presumably from the Tiste Edur. It is very difficult for us mortals to make sense of Tiste histories . . . human history is ever marked by certain personalities, rising . . . .to shatter the status quo. Fortunately for us, such men and women are few and far between, and they all eventually die or disappear. But among the Tiste, well, those personalities never go away, or so it seems. They act, and act yet again. They persist. Choose the worst tyrant from . . . human history, Heboric, then imagine him or her as virtually undying. In your mind, bring that tyrant back again and again and again. How, having done so, would you imagine our history then?” Heboric answers human history would be far more violent than Tiste, and says he has never even heard of a Tiste tyrant. L’oric says perhaps tyrant isn’t the right word; he meant “in human context, a personality of devastating power, or potential. Look at his this Malazan Empire, born from the mind of Kellanved, a single man. What if he had been eternal?” Heboric laughs that maybe he is, and tells L’oric he’s missing something: “the Tiste are no longer isolated in their scheming. There are humans, now, in their games—humans, who’ve not the patience of the Tiste, nor their legendary remoteness . . . Kurald Galain and Kurald Emurlahn are no longer pure, unsullied by human presence. Meanas and Rashan? Perhaps they are proving the doors into both Darkness and Shadow. Or . . . how can one truly hope to separate the themes of Darkness and Light from Shadow? . . . An interdependent triumvirate. Mother, father, and child—a family ever squabbling, only now the in-laws and grandchildren are joining in.” L’oric is stunned into silence, then says he’d come to warn of Tiste meddling in human affairs and Heboric ended up warning him about the opposite. As L’oric speaks, Heboric feels ” a strange, whispering suspicion . . . as if tickled into being by something in L’oric’s voice.” But he dismisses it as “Too outrageous, too absurd.” Instead, he asks L’oric to tell him about the statue. L’oric says what about Heboric’s side and when Heboric says he doesn’t know who might be listening, L’oric tells him he has raised wards and illusions to prevent it. Heboric says if L’oric wants details about Sha’ik and the new Master of the Deck, it’ll have to be in Sha’ik’s presence and L’oric will have to reveal more of himself. L’oric then says “tell me this . . . He was created in the wake of the Malazan disaster on Genabackis . . . he was of, or is somehow related to, the Bridgeburners, for they were destroyed in the Pannion Domin.” Heboric says he can’t be certain but it seems likely. L’oric continues: “So the Malazan influence ever grows—not just on our mundane world, but throughout the warrens and now n the Deck of Dragons.” But Heboric points out that L’oric is making a common mistake in assuming the Empire is monolithic; “I do not believe this Master of the Deck is some servant of the Empress. Indeed, he kneels before no one.” When L’oric asks why the Bridgeburner guardians then, Heboric replies “some loyalties defy Hood himself.” L’oric then connects that the Master was a soldier in the Bridgeburners and says that makes sense. He explains that Kimloc, a Spiritwalker, has given the Bridgeburners a Tanno song that “begins here, in Raraku . . . the birthplace of the Bridgeburners.” He asks if Heboric knows the significance of this, but then goes on to say the significance has waned, “since the Bridgeburners are no more, there can be no sanctification . . . For the song to be sanctified, a Bridgeburner would have to return to Raraku . . . and that does not seem likely . . . Tanno sorcery is elliptical. The song must be like a serpent eating its tail. Kimloc’s Song of the Bridgeburners is at the moment without an end. But it has been sung and so lives . . . like a spell that remains active, awaiting resolution.” Heboric interrupts to ask about the jade giant and L’oric tells him the first one was found in the otataral mines (more than one surprises Heboric) . . . and the miners who got too close vanished. Sections of two other giants were found and those veins have been closed off. He says they are “intruders to our world from some other realm,” and Heboric adds, “arriving only to be wrapped in chains of otataral.” L’oric says it does appear that the arrival has been anticipate each time and is making sure the threat is negated. But Heboric disagrees, arguing that the passage of the giants through a portal is what creates the otataral, though he can’t be certain. He says one scholar though otataral was created by the “annihilation of all that is necessary for sorcery to operate. Like slag with all the ore burnt out . . . the absolute draining of energy—the energy that rightfully exists in all things, whether animate or otherwise . . . Perhaps the magnitude of the sorcery unleashed—a spell that is all-devouring of the energy it feeds on.” L’oric objects even the gods couldn’t wield so much power, but Heboric says he thinks a ritual, a collective sorcery could do it. L’oric says like the Telann Ritual and Heboric says yes, or the calling down of the Crippled God, which leaves L’oric speechless for a while. L’oric then says he has one last piece of information that he sees he must give, though it will reveal much about himself. As Heboric listens, “the confines of his hut dimmed to insignificance, the heat of the hearth no longer reaching him, until the only sensation left came from his ghostly hands . . . at the ends of his wrists, they became the weight of the world.”</p><p>Scene 5</p><p>Leoman sees Karsa off. Karsa warns him not to strike so hard at Tavore’s army that he “awaken[s] the bear,” but Leoman scoffs. In turn, Leoman warns Karsa that “if ou must kneel before a power, first look upon it with clear eyes.” Karsa heads off, flanked by his two friends, whom he can see and hear.</p><p>Scene 6</p><p>Reloe tells Dom Karsa has left. Dom thinks of how he has nothing but contempt for Reloe and for sorcerers in general. They both anticipate Leoman soon-departure and think Febryl will now “advance his plans.” Dom worries about Heboric still, but Reloe calls him a “doddering fool” who isn’t even aware that the hen’bara tea he drinks to alleviate his visions is actually enhancing them. The two discuss their plans that will lead them to the final goal: “the throne that will one day belong to us.” The plans include:</p><ul><li>Febryl kills Sha’ik.</li><li>Tavore kills Febryl</li><li>Dom and Reloe destroy Tavore and the Malazan army</li><li>Dom and Reloe destroy the Seven Cities rebellion themselves</li><li>The Empress calls them back to reward them</li><li>They kill the Empress (not clear if them literally or someone else wielding the knife)</li><li>The Talons destroy the Claws</li><li>Dujek is helpless a continent away</li></ul><p>Also involved in the conspiracy is Mallick Rel, to what extent is unclear.</p><p>Reloe brings up L’oric as a concern, but Dom just tell him to “deal with him.” As Reloe leaves, Dom thinks of how he’d get rid of all magic if he could, “return the fate of mortals to the mortals themselves.” Then the world would belong to him and people like him, “and the empire he would shape would permit no ambiguity, no ambivalence. His will unopposed, the Napan could end, once and for all, teh dissonant clangor that so plagued humanity, now and throughout history. ‘I will bring order. And from that unity, we shall rid the world of every other race, every other people, we shall overpower and crush every discordant vision . . . ” And he revels in the fact that the opponents he feared—Whiskeyjack and the Bridgeburners—are no longer in the game against him: “You are now at Hood’s feet, Whiskyjack . . . You and your damned company . . . None left to stop me now.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Eleven</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Gamet, Tavore, and Baralta have left the city ahead of the army, which is marching today, and are looking over Coltaine’s Fall. The hill is riddled with ants and filled with memorials—braids woven into chains, dog skulls, crow feathers, etc. Tavore asks who is responsible for all these things and Baralta identifies a number of clans—Khundryl, Semk, and others. When Tavore asks how it came to be that those who fought Coltaine now make pilgrimages and honor him, Baralta has no answer, though he says this is nothing compared to what’s at Aren’s Way. Gamet believes he knows what Tavore is thinking: “We must walk, step by step, the legacy. We? No. Tavore. Alone . . . she now realizes . . . that she will stride that man’s shadow all the way to Raraku.” Tavore dismisses both men. Before leaving, Gamet tells her the Crow Clan isn’t accepting Temul as commander and she says she’ll deal with it. As he rides back, Gamet thinks on Duiker’s final acts before being staked to a tree, and also on the fact that his body was never found. Baralta asks Gamet to convince him that Tavore is equal to her task, and when Gamet replies she is, Baralta says some day Gamet will have to tell him what she had done “to earn such loyalty.” Gamet thinks to himself “can you not see the truth before you? She has done nothing. I beg you. Leave an old man to his faith.”</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Fiddler and Gesler are following a supply wagon on the Aren Way, in the midst of a conversation. We come in as Gesler says “faith is for fools,” and Fiddler replies that “Every soldier knows . . . without faith, you are already as good as dead. Faith in the soldier at your side . . . and no matter how delusional . . . faith you cannot be killed.” Gesler points out the trees still showing the spike holes and bloodstains and says to ask the ghosts about faith. Fiddler says that faith was betrayed doesn’t ruin the idea of faith, but Gesler answers that “some things you can’t step around with words and lofty ideas. And comes down to who is in that vanguard . . . The Adjunct. Who just lost an argument with that pack of hoary Wickans.” He adds that Fiddler has been lucky in his commanders, but Gesler had Dom, who thought Whiskeyjack was “unfulfilled potential [Dom thought] If only the bastard had been hard enough, he could’ve taken the damn throne.” Gesler says Dom thought Whiskeyjack’s failure was a betrayal. Fiddler says Dom can complain to WJ in person since the Empress will probably send the Genabackan army over. As they walk, they pass trees laden with fetishes or painted with the figures of the soldiers that had been spiked on them. Tavore had forbidden the cutting down of the trees when the idea had been mentioned, and Fiddler wonders if she regrets that now. He looks at the Fourteenth’s standard—a thin figure holding up a bone before a sandstorm—and he thinks Tavore at least understood that whole thing well, though he also wonder at the “curious coincidence” that the standard “could as easily apply to Sha’ik’s army of the Apocalypse . . . As if Tavore and Sha’ik—the two armies, the forces in opposition—are in some way mirrored reflections of the other.” He finds that there have been a lot of strange things happening, including the fact that he was “feeling strangely fevered . . . Strains of a barely heard song rose up from the depths of his mind on occasion, a haunting song that made his flesh prickle. And stranger still, the song was entirely unfamiliar.” He muses as well on how the reflections isn’t just Tavore and Sha’ik but is also Tavore and Coltaine as they reverse-walk Coltaine’s path, and himself and Raraku as he returns to “the desert that saw me destroyed only to rise once more, mysteriously renewed—a renewal that persists, since for an old man I neither look nor feel old. And so it remains for all of us Bridgeburners, as if Raraku stole something of our mortality, and replaced it with something else.”</p><p>As they walk his thoughts turn to his squad. Koryk and Tarr look good he thinks, Smiles reminds him of Sorry, Bottle he thinks of as a young mage with a handful of minor spells, and Cuttle he sees as a “burlier, more miserable version of Hedge. Having Cuttle there was like coming home.” Gesler points out the tree where they found Duiker, saying they hadn’t said anything because Truth was so hopeful, but when they returned the body was gone. Strings starts to say Tavore should call a stop but is interrupted when she does just that. Gesler, Borduke, and Fiddler discuss how their mages are all Meanas (Gesler’s mage is Tavos Pond and Fiddler’s is Bottle) and maybe they can use that, maybe with illusions. Ranal comes by and after some words with Gesler, says Keneb wants an inventory of mages. Gesler begins to say they have none, but Fiddler interrupts and says they have three, but only minor ones. Ranal leaves and Fiddler tells Gesler to go easy on him and maybe Keneb will teach him some things. Gesler isn’t so sure about Keneb either though, suspicious that Keneb was the only one of his company to survive. Fiddler tells him it’s a bit early to “start honing the knives,” and Gesler says he can wait.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>At the end of the first day, Gamet thinks they haven’t gone very far at all, unsurprisingly. He looks at the Wickans and thinks they’re all either very old or very young: the old here for Coltaine’s memory he may have fought against; the young he thinks are here because they “were being fed the singular poison of bitter old fighters filled with tales of past glory.” He pities Temul for his problems with the Wickan elders. He joins Tavore in her tent as she is sealing away her otataral sword. She tells him they await news, then Topper (Claw Master) appears from a portal and gives greetings from the Empress. He tells them he comes from Genabackis, where he got drunk with Tayschrenn, the clear implication being that he comes with bad news. Tavore steels herself and asks what the new is. Topper begins his report with “Losses . . . terrible losses.”</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Bottle is off a ways magically eavesdropping on Tavore’s tent via “riding” the small creatures nearby. He thinks of his grandmother’s advice back in Malaz City: “never mind those damned warrens, child, the deep magic is far older. Remember, seek out the roots and tendrils . . . the invisible web woven from creature to creature. Every creature . . . they are all linked. And it is within you . . . to ride those tendrils.”</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Tavos Pond and Balgrid tell Fiddler Bottle is out there but they can’t sense him. Bottle shows up and tells them all a portal opened in Tavore’s tent. Then tells them the news he heard: Dujek’s army nearly wiped out, the Bridgeburners annihilated, and Whiskeyjack dead. Fiddler goes numb and walks away. He comes across Temul weeping beside his horse. Temul puts his hand to his knife and Fiddler tells him “Relax . . . I’m in grief’s arms this night myself” and then when Temul starts to leave, Fiddler tells him “Face me. I will be your witness this night and we alone will know of it.” Temul tells him his tears were of self-pity, “Proclaim me—I am done with commanding, for I cannot command myself.” Fiddler says he isn’t going to say anything to anyone. He guesses Temul’s problem and says he had a commander once who had the same problem, having to lead a bunch of children. When Temul asks what the commander did, Fiddler says “not much and ended up with a knife in his back,” adding he isn’t one for “stories with lessons in life.” He continues, saying Tavore probably shares Temul’s frustration over his position and would like to help him but worries about Temul losing face. He suggests stealing the Wickan’s horses; “If children your kin must be, then take away their favored playthings . . . hard to look tall and imperious when you’re spitting dust behind a wagon.” Fiddler asks about the scroll hanging from his horse and Temul tells him it was Duiker’s, then talks of how impressed he and the others (Coltaine, Bult) were with Duiker. He says Coltaine even gave Duiker the “soul trapper” stone from Baruk, adding the elders have spoken of a child born to the tribe “once empty, then filled, for the crows came.” Fiddler asks if Coltaine has been reborn and Temul says yes, then says he keeps Duiker’s horse for “when he returns.” Fiddler reminds Temul that Duiker looked to him, not just Nil and Nether, to guard the refugees. Temul stands stronger and says he goes to tell the Adjunct what he plans with the Wickan horses. The two agree that Fiddler saw nothing this night, then Temul leaves and Fiddler buries his head in his hands.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Topper has finished his report, including Paran’s “heroism, then his death. Not a single Bridgeburner left alive. Tayschrenn himself saw their bodies, witness their internment in Moon’s Spawn. But lass, Ganoes redeemed himself—redeemed the family name.” Gamet, though, thinks that cuts Tavore even more, for she made so many sacrifices and Paran had never been a renegade or responsible for Lorn’s death—”thus, the sacrifice of young Felisin might have in the end proved unnecessary.” Topper also informed them that Laseen had planned to land Dujek’s Host on the north to open up a second front and have Dujek take overall command (news of which Gamet thinks will be a blow to Tavore’s confidence), but while Dujek will still be coming, it will be late and as a broken man in charge of a devastated army. Gamet thinks Tavore should have been told all this before; now she’s been told the Empress never had confidence in her but now has no choice but to leave the fate of the Empire in Seven Cities to Tavore. When Tavore asks if that’s it, Topper is surprised and says, yes, then asks if Tavore wants to send a message to Laseen. Tavore says no. Topper says one last thing is that some in the army may grieve over the fall of Fener and there may be desertions, but Tavore interrupts and says there will be none, then dismisses Topper. When Topper tries to give her some last military advice, Tavore tells him his role is Clawmaster; from Dujek—a solider, commander—she’ll take advice but otherwise follow her own instincts and if Laseen doesn’t like the results, she can replace her. Topper leaves, as does Gamet after Tavore tells him to get T’amber.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Fiddler returns to camp; Cuttle is the only one still at the fire. Cuttle tells Fiddler “it’s all far away” and Fiddler answers “But it feels close.” Cuttle thanks him for the munitions and Fiddler says how weird it is that “we always find more, and they’re meant to be used, but instead we horde them, tell no-one we have them—in case they order us to put them to use.” When Cuttle says he’ll use them to get Dom even if he has to “go to Hood” himself at the same time, Fiddler says he thinks that’s what Hedge did, adding he wish he could have been there with them all, naming them. Cuttle corrects him on Quick Ben, saying he’s alive and made a High Mage by Tayschrenn. Fiddler says he isn’t surprised, and then when he wonders if Paran was still captain, Cuttle says he was and died with them. Fiddler is curious if Tavore is grieving and Cuttle answers that “wondering’s a waste of time. We got lads and lasses that need taking care of right here.” The two of them discuss what sort of “iron” their army will or should be.</p><p>Iron, Strings smiled . . . Since we’re looking for revenge, you’ll want it hot I expect.</p><p>You expect wrong. Look at Tavore—there won’t be any heat from her . . . She’s just like Coltaine. It’s obvious Fiddler. The iron needs to be cold. Cold. We get it cold enough, who knows, we might earn ourselves a name.</p><p>Strings . . . tapped the finger bone hanging from Cuttle’s belt. We’ve made a start, I think.</p><p>We might have at that, Sergeant. Them and the standards. She knows what’s in her, give her that. She knows what’s in her.</p><p>And it’s for us to bring it out into view.</p><p>As Fiddler goes to bed, he thinks “Iron. Cold iron. Yes, it’s in her. And now I’d better search and search hard to find it in me.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Twelve</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Cutter watches as Darist arms himself for battle. Darist tells him they probably won’t survive the Edur’s attack, saying five Edur ships survived the storm and two have reached the shore. He adds there would have been more, but a Malazan fleet “happened upon them by chance . . . Your human kin did well—far better than the Edur no doubt anticipated . . . There was a skilled mage among the humans—the exchange of sorcery was impressive.” When Cutter complains the Andii didn’t help, Darist says they haven’t left the island for decades and doesn’t answer when Cutter asks why. Darist picks up his sword and Cutter says it looks like it would snap in contact with a heavier weapon. Darist replies it won’t: “There are many names for this particular sword . . . Its maker called it Vengeance. T’an Aros, in our language. But I call it K’orladis . . .Grief.” Cutter asks who made it and Darist answer it was Rake, “before he found one more suited to his nature.” Darist asks if Cutter plans to fight and when Cutter says “yes,” Darist wonders why since it isn’t his fight. Cutter replies that Rake and the Andii fought for Genabackis even though it wasn’t their battle either, which makes Darist smile. They climb up and out of the hall into ruins. Darist informs Cutter that the buildings were constructed by the Edur and were in ruins when the Andii arrived. They cross to a courtyard and await the Edur. Cutter asks if Vengeance/Grief is invested, and Darist says, “The power of Grief lies in the focused intent in its creation. The sword demands a singular will in its wielder. With such a will, it cannot be defeated.” He also implies he doesn’t have that kind of will. A group of Edur arrive and attack and Darist and Cutter hold them off (Darist takes some major wounds) until they are relieved by a group of young Andii and Apsalar. Apsalar tells Cutter she found the Andii hiding at Darist’s (Andarist’s) command. Darist tells her now the young ones will die, “for the Edur will now hunt them down in earnest, the old hatred, rekindled once more.” Apsalar answers that the Throne has to be protected. Darist angrily says, “if he truly wants it protected, then he can come here and do it himself.” Apsalar asks who the “he” is and Cutter tells her Rake, Darist’s brother.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Cutter thought Darist’s expression was confirmation enough that Darist is Rake’s younger brother. He learns that the youths are Rake’s grandchildren (by different mothers). Darist is badly wounded, and Cutter is impressed he was able to fight on as he did. Cutter says he’s surprised by the Andii youths, and by their lack of training in fighting. Apsalar worries Darist’s overprotectiveness may doom them, and her words have, to Cutter, a sense of harsh judgment. He muses he had though, based on his experience with Rallick Nom that “a singular capacity to inflict death engendered a certain wisdom—of the fragility of the spirit, of its mortality” but he senses none of that in Apsalar. He thinks she took no pleasure in killing the Edur, though she “had not intended” that they died slowly, and thinks it’s as if she were trained as a torturer, though Dancer was not one. He worries the ugly aspect is part of her own personality. Saying Cutter is in no shape to fight, Apsalar suggests he find the Malazan survivors on the island and ask their help. Cutter agrees to go.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Cutter travels through the forest which is built upon the ruins of a great city. He finds a cave (Apsalar had discovered the Malazan earlier). He calls out to the Malazans inside and a group come out. He tells them of the Edur, their attack, and asks their help, saying the Edur are after something that could doom the Malazan Empire and “all of humanity.” When they scoff, he tells them it’s the Throne of Shadow. The Dal Honese man startles at this while one of the woman, horribly burned, says, “True words . . . a fleet set out on a search . . . and now they’ve found it. Ammanas and Cotillion are about to be usurped, and what of it?” She’s angered they fought the Edur for the Throne, losing ships, people, and probably her own life. Another woman declares it isn’t their fight, but the Dal Honese, called Traveler by the women tells them “the Throne must not be claimed by the Edur . . . the lad speaks without exaggeration when he describes the risks . . . The Warren of Shadow is now human-aspected . . . and it well suits our natures. This battles is ours—we face it now or we face it later.” When one woman, the Captain/Commander asks if he claims this in the name of the Empire, he answers “More than you know.” Cutter asks if the burned woman is a sorcerer and the captain says yes, but she’s dying and is about to add more when they hear a distant noise and Cutter yells “they’ve attacked again, with magic this time—follow me.” Cutter reaches the courtyard, spotting a group of Edur coming up from the coast. Leaving them to the Malazans, he heads into the courtyard to see a line of Edur warrior and four Edur mages sending out waves of magic to attack Darist, who stood alone with Apsalar unconscious at his feet and behind him the scattered bodies of the young Andii. Darist is horribly wounded, bones visible through his chest, but he stands before the magic, Grief white hot and keening. Cutter calls for Blind. The Hound appears, but one of the Edur mages says something and Blind “cowered.” Shadows suddenly appear in the courtyard then Cotillion is there, wielding his rope and killing the four sorcerers in a blink, then the dozen plus Edur warriors as well. It all took “four breaths.” Cotillion starts to yell at Blind, then sees the Hound trembling and dismisses it. Cutter tells him the Malazans need help, but Cutter says, “No they don’t.” Darist finally falls and Cotillion tells Cutter “When he’s done out there, guide him to this sword. Tell him its names.” He vanishes. As Cutter is bent over Apsalar, Traveler walks in carrying a broken sword, the only Malazan survivor. When Cutter looks out he sees 50+ Edur corpses. Traveler reaches for Darist’s sword and Cutter tells him “it is named Vengeance or Grief. You can choose which best suits you.” Traveler asks if Cutter wants it, and Cutter replies, “It demands its wielder possesses a singular will. I am not for that sword, no, I think, will I ever be.” Traveler names it Vengeance, then asks who Darist was. Cutter gives his name (but not his relation to Rake) and says he guarded the Throne and now it has no guard. Traveler says he will stay for a while, help tend the wounded and bury the dead. Cutter says he’ll help, but Traveler tells him there’s no need; Cotillion killed all the Edur on the ships as well, and so Cutter and Apsalar can take a small boat and supplies and head out. Apsalar starts to waken and Traveler says it’s time for them to go. Cutter sees sorrow in his eyes for the first time and again offers to help bury the dead, but Traveler says it won’t be the first time he’s buried companions. As Cutter turns to go, carrying Apsalar, Traveler says, “Thank your god, mortal, for the sword.”</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Kalam is examining the well shaft Kindly went down and asks what drove the Captain to go down there. Cord points out there’s “something lying on the bottom, maybe twice a man’s height in depth . . . Looks like a man all in armor, lying spread-eagled.” Cord doesn’t like Kalam’s attitude and Kalam pulls rank on him, tells him Kindly and the lieutenant aren’t coming back and he’s taking them out. Kalam is left alone and lowers a stone down to the figure to measure depth and the creature’s true size. The figure yanks on the rope and Kalam is pulled downward into the underground river. He’s grabbed by the rotting creature, which mentally speaks to Kalam: “The other two eluded me, but you I will have. I am so hungry.” Kalam stabs it with both his long knives and the creature throws him upward, back into the chamber above. Cord runs in and asks what happened. Kalam, seeing the river below is running red with blood, tells Cord to stop using the well.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>The others join Kalam and help pry his knives out of his hands—the grips had scorched his palms with cold. Kalam and Ebron the mage discuss the history of B’ridys. Kalam says the fortress had been a monastery of a long extinct cult—the Nameless Ones. Ebron says the “Tanno cult claims a direct decent from the cult of the Nameless Ones. The Spiritwalkers say their powers, of song and the like, arose from the original patterns that the Nameless Ones fashioned in their rituals.” Kalam says the Nameless ones used to chain demons and he and Ebron realize that anyone drinking the water tainted with the creature’s blood: “The demon takes that person’s [or animal’s] soul and makes the exchange. Freedom.” They also realize that once it’s free, it will come after Kalam and both agree the others need to get far away from Kalam. Kalam tells them of Tavore’s march from Aren and tells them she could use their veteran experience. He adds he’ll be heading for Raraku. He tells them the demon told him their two officers got away, then they all leave.</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Kalam exits the fortress. As he travels west, he hears the distant scream of an enkar’al (a huge winged reptile). He heads for the Whirlwind, getting abraded as he nears it. He’s attacked by the demon—possessed enkar’al, It toys with him, causing Kalam to lose consciousness at one point. He awakens and when it asks if it’s ready to play again, he says it broke his back. When it nears to attack, he shoves rocks and sand down its throat while stabbing it with a dagger. He crawls to his serpent dagger and kills the demon/enkar’al, then passes out.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>The enkar’al that drank the blood of the demon was “exchanged”—the demon possessed the enkar’al body while the enkar’al soul entered the body back in the fortress, a pureblood Toblakai that had been possessed by the demon long ago. The wolf gods on the Beast Throne, in need of a champion, calm the soul and speak to it, offering a time of service in exchange for later reward of “rejoin [ing] its kin in the skies of another realm.” The enkar’al agrees.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>Pust finds Kalam (he says he’s been looking for him) and tells him “you have something for me, something to deliver. A bone whistle? A small bag, perchance? Given to you in a shadowy realm by an even shadowier god? A bag, you fool, filled with dusky diamonds?” Kalam replies “You’re the one, are you?” and reaches for the bag but then passes out again, just after seeing the azalan demon behind Pust.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>Kalam awakens feeling healed, though stiff. Pust appears, tells Kalam to be quiet because his wife is hunting him (Pust), then disappears. Mogora appears right after, saying, “the bastard was here, wasn’t he?” She mentions veering and Kalam figures out from what Pust had said she’s Soletaken/spiders. She leaves, Pust reappears.</p><p>SCENE 10</p><p>Severed from his vow, Onrack can no longer see his kin’s “ghost-shapes;” he can see only their physicality: “Withered corpses. Ghastly. Devoid of majesty. Duty and courage had been made animate, and this was all the T’lan Imass were, and had been for hundreds of thousands of years. Yet, without choice, such virtues as duty and courage were transformed into empty, worthless words. Without mortality, hovering like an unseen sword overhead, meaning was without relevance, no matter the nature—or even the motivation—of the act.” He thinks he is seeing what all non-T’lan Imass see when they look upon his race: “An extinct past refusing to fall to dust. Brutal reminders of rectitude and intransigence, of a vow elevated insanity.” He wonders how this is or should make him feel, and then wonders when it last was that feeling even mattered to him. Trull mentions that he is surprised Onrack doesn’t flee his kin who want to dismantle him once they reach their realm and Onrack says that is what the renegades he hunted did, and now he understands them. Trull points out though they did not simply flee but found someone else to serve, an option not available to Onrack unless he serves the Liosan. “Or you,” Onrack says, adding that Monok Ochem would see that as a crime similar to that of the renegades. Onrack tells Trull he’s the one who should flee, but Trull says Monok told him they need only a drop or two of his blood for the portal ritual. Onrack says that’s true, if all goes well, but points out that Seneschal Jorrude is not a sorcerer but a warriorpriest and to use Kurald Thyrllan, he must “kneel before his power,” rather than command it as sorcerers do. He explains the assumption is that the power is benign, but if the power has been usurped, one may not be able to tell, “and then you become a victim, a tool, manipulated to serve unknown purposes.” He goes on to say that Osseric is “lost. Osric as humans know him . . . Thus, the hand behind the seneschal’s power is probably not Osseric, but some other entity, hidden behind the guise and the name of Osseric. Yet these Tiste Liosan proceed unaware . . . [they are] in pursuit of trespassers who passed through their fiery warren . . . Kurald Thyrllan is not a sealed warren. It lies close to our own Tellann—for Tellann draws from it. Fire is life and life is fire. Fire is the war against cold . . . our salvation. Bonecasters have made use of Kurald Thyrllan . . . For it seemed there were no Tiste Liosan. Monok Ochem considers this now . . . Where are these Liosan from? . . . Why are they now awakened to resentment? What does the one hidden behind the guise of Osseric seek?” Trull asks him to stop; it’s all too much. Silent now, Onrack muses on the two Hounds he’d freed. He feels they are no longer in the Nascent and thinks of them as “shadow and spirit reunited . . . As if each were shaped of two distinct powers, two aspects chained together.” He wonders if he had merely “unleashed” them rather than “freed” them. “Shadow from Dark. That which is cast from that which has cast it.” He looks on his own shadows and wonders if there is “tension between him and them . . . Silent kin of mine. You precede. You follow . . . Your world finds its shape from my bone and flesh. Yet your breadth and length belong to Light. You are the bridge between worlds, you cannot be walked. No substance then. Only perception.” Monok asks what Onrack is thinking and he tells the bonecaster he remains “bound to your path . . . The renegade kin must be found. They are our shadows. I now stand between you and them and so I can guide you . . . Destroy me and you shall lose an advantage.” Monok asks if he is bargaining for “persistence” and Onrack answers he is, and then refuses to tell Monok what path the renegades took until “it becomes relevant.” The Tellann warren is readied and Jorrude says he’ll begin his prayers and thus prove that Osric is not lost to the Liosan. When Trull says he wants Onrack to be the one to draw his blood, Jorrude says it should be him instead as “blood lies at the heart of Osric’s power,” a statement that startles Monok. Trull says it’ll be Onrack or nobody and reveals he’s holding a pair of munitions; Monok tells Jorrude to back down and he does, though angrily. The “godfire” appears and they all enter the ritual’s circle. Onrack can sense the approach of the “outermost layers of disguise” of whatever is passing for the Liosan’s god. Onrack gives Trull his knife and tells him to cut himself when Onrack gives the order, saying he doesn’t want to be distracted during the crossing. As the fire grows, Onrack wonders again at what being is behind it: “if these Liosan were any indication, it found sustenance from purity, as if such a thing was even possible. Intransigence. Simplicity. The simplicity of blood, a detail whispering of antiquity, of primeval origins. A spirit, then, before whom a handful of savages once bowed. There had been many such entities once, born of the primitive assertion of meaning to object, meaning shaped by symbols and portents, scratchings on rock faces and in the depths of caves . . . but tribes died out . . . The secret language of the scratchings . . . all lost, forgotten. And with that fading away. . so too the spirits themselves dwindled, usually into oblivion. That some lingered was not surprising to Onrack . . . What was new . . . was the sense of pathos. In the name of purity, the Liosan worship their god. In the name of nostalgia, the god worships what was and shall never again return.” Jorrude cuts himself and Onrack tells Trull to do the same and a gate tears open with tunnels reaching from it, chaos between tunnels. Blood is spraying from Trull’s hand. Onrack sees Ibra Gholan, Olar Shayn, and Haran Epal vanish down a tunnel of fire while the Liosan rush to Jorrude unconscious body. Onrack drags Trull close and grabs Trull’s bloody hand, then swears service to Trull, pledging to defend his life. Then they move into a tunnel. Monok veers into his Soletaken form—a giant ape—and pursues, but then vanishes in a surge of chaos. Onrack and Trull land on ground back in their home realm and Onrack says they have to leave as the T’lan Imass will pursue, even if only Monok remains. Trull asks where the others went and Onrack tells him they went into Kurald Thyrllan to kill the Liosan god.</p><p>SCENE 11</p><p>Pearl and Lostar Yill are moving through bones and armor scraps—the remains of an army buried in ash inside the Imperial Warren. Pearl says last time he passed this same way there were no ruins, bones, or the pit. He adds he’s found a portal (“a lively one”), but it’s down in the pit. He leaves it to her if they look for a more accessible one, but she chooses the pit. She asks if he knows who the dead soldiers are and he says no, but he can tell they fought in the ash, so they were either survivors of whatever calamity caused the devastation or they were intruders afterward. They fall down a sandslide into the pit, Lostara ending up next to an edge. Pearl cast a magical light and they see “An X-shaped cross, tilting over them, as tall as a four-story building. The glint of enormous, pitted spikes. And nailed to the cruciform—a dragon. Wings spread, pinned wide. Hind limbs impaled. Chains wrapped about its neck, holding its massive wedge-shaped head up as if staring skyward to a seas of stars marked here and there with swirls of glowing mist.” Pearl points out it is enclosed in a “pocket warren, a realm unto itself.” Lostara says it could also be sealing an entranceway and Pearl thinks she may be right. He tells her the dragon is aspected: “Otataral. Her aspect is otataral, woman. This is an otataral dragon.”</p><p>SCENE 12</p><p>Pearl uses magic to free them from the sandslide and they examine the dragon. Pearl tells her it’s still alive and when Lostara asks who could have done this, he says whoever they were should be thanked: “this thing devours magic. Consumes warrens.” When Lostara objects, saying all the old stories say dragons are the “essence of sorcery,” he responds: “Nature always seeks a balance. Forces strive for symmetry. This dragon answers every other dragon that ever existed, or ever will.” Lostara asks what the Imperial Warren was before it was turned to ash, but he doesn’t answer. They head deeper down toward the gate, which Pearl assumes was used by whoever nailed the dragon onto the cross.</p><p>SCENE 13</p><p>They reach the gate, which Pearl identifies as “The Elder Warren from which Thyr derived . . . Kurald something. Tiste. Not Edur, not Andii.” He points out dragon tracks, at least six, and says that solves the question about who could chain/crucify a dragon. The step through the gate “into a realm of gold fire,” that was, “for the moment, survivable” though it sears their lungs. In front of them is a pillar shaped like a pyramid, carved with the names of those who chained the Otataral Dragon. A wall of flame heads for them and Pearl, reacting, slips on a trail of blood. They run around the pillar into a cavern splattered in blood and with pieces of a T’lan Imass scattered around. Pearl grabs the head then uses his warren to send them home. Pearl tells the head if it answers his questions, he’ll find it a nice view. Olar Shayn identifies himself and tells Pearl, when asked about what he was doing, that he and his kin killed “a false god.” Pearl asks if this ledge is a good enough spot and Olar says yes. Pearl secures him a spot and he and Lostara prepare to pick up the hunt for Felisin.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.820947794907868">Leoman’s 2000-strong force is ready to leave. Dom watches as Leoman speaks to Sha’ik, thinking he’d be just as happy if Leoman didn’t return and gloating over Sha’ik’s clear ignorance of his plans that were “settling into place to achieve her own demise.” Sha’ik reminds Leoman he is not to engage the Malazan army. Leoman tells her they’ve already probably been harassed by local tribes, but she responds those are mere skirmishes and those tribes are sending people to her everyday. Leoman’s would be easily their largest foe and she doesn’t want Tavore facing such a foe yet. Leoman agrees, then tells Heboric if he needs anything to seek out Mathok, a statement that gets both Dom’s and Sha’ik’s attention. Sha’ik calls it “an odd thing to say” since Heboric is under her protection. Leoman said he just wanted to ensure Sha’ik wasn’t distracted from preparing her army, an army, Dom points out, she entrusted Dom to run. Leoman says goodbye and as he moves away, Dom tells Sha’ik that Leoman will disobey orders. She replies, “of course he will.” Dom says he shouldn’t be allowed to leave then and Sha’ik asks if Dom is now suddenly fearful of Tavore’s army? She says Leoman’s attacks will be irrelevant; Tavore’s army is weak and shaky and young. Dom argues for keeping Leoman “leashed,” and Sha’ik says what he really means is “killed,” but if Leoman is a “mad dog” then where better to send him than against their enemy. She adds that Febryl is impatiently waiting for Dom in Dom’s tent, dismissing him cavalierly, and telling him “brittle self-importance” is a flaw in “aging men”, speaking allegedly of Febryl.</span></p><p>SCENE 2</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.820947794907868">After Dom leaves, Heboric asks Sha’ik if she is trying to goad the conspirators into acting though Leoman and Karsa, the only ones to trust, are gone. Sha’ik tells him she trusts none but herself. As for Leoman and Karsa, “when they look upon me they see an imposter.” Heboric asks if she trusts him, and she answer that he cannot leave now, before the battle, but afterward she will extend the Whirlwind all the way for him so as to ease his journey. Heboric asks what doesn’t she know and she replies far too much, naming L’oric specifically as a mystery, saying he can block even the Whirlwind’s magic. Heboric tells her what L’oric has revealed to him was in confidence, but he can say L’oric isn’t her enemy. She’s relieved, but when she asks if that means L’oric is her ally, Heboric doesn’t answer. She accepts that and moves on to ask about Bidithal’s “explorations” of Rashan, his old warren. Heboric and Sha’ik discuss that the Whirlwind is a fragment of Kurald Emurlahn whose “true rulers had ceased to exist, thus leaving it vulnerable,” and that the Whirlwind is the largest such fragment and it’s power is growing. She says Bidithal sees himself as the fragment’s “penultimate—[its] High Priest,” but he doesn’t know such a role doesn’t exist as Sha’ik is “High Priestess . . . single mortal manifestation of the Whirlwind.” She says Bidithal wants to “enfold Rashan into the Whirlwind” or use the Whirlwind to “cleanse the Shadow Realm of its false rulers,” the former leaders of the Malazan Empire. So many parts, she adds, to this upcoming battle, and the challenge is to “cajole all those disparate motives into one, mutually triumphant effect.” To do so, she says, she needs the secret of Heboric’s hands—they are defeating otataral and she needs to know how to do that. Heboric starts to answer she really doesn’t, as the fragment’s Elder magic will be unaffected, but Sha’ik interrupts and says Tavore will use her otataral sword to negate Sha’ik’s advantage in her High Mages. Heboric asks what that matters as Tavore can’t defeat the Whirlwind, and Sha’ik answers because the Whirlwind can’t defeat Tavore. At first this shocked Heboric, but then he realizes it makes sense as Kurald Emurlahn is so weak—in pieces, “riven through with Rashan—a warren that was indeed vulnerable to the effects of otataral.” He realizes the two magics will obviate each other, leaving it up to Dom, “who knows it and he has his own ambitions.” Heboric says he understands what she needs and why, but he has no control over the power of his hands and she says he’s getting closer because of the tea. This crushes Heboric as he had thought her suggestion of the tea for his nightmares was “compassion . . . a gift. He felt something crumbling inside of him. A fortress in the desert of my heart. I should have known it would be a fortress of sand . . . Stay? He felt no longer able to leave. Chains. She has made for me a house of chains.”</span></p><p>SCENE 3</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.820947794907868">At Leoman’s pit, Silgar appears and tells Felisin the warrior from Mathok doesn’t want to meet there due to concerns over prying eyes, but he is waiting for her in the ruins across the plaza. Felisin accepts the need for secrecy and follows him to the temple there, where Bidithal takes her captive. He tells her he plans to “drink all the pleasure from your precious body, leaving naught but bitterness, naught but dead places within. It is necessary . . . I take no unsavoury pleasure in what I must do. The children of the Whirlwind must be riven barren to make of them perfect reflections of the goddess herself . . . the goddess cannot create, only destroy. The source of her fury no doubt.”</span></p><p>SCENE 4</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.820947794907868">Silgar smiles as he hears what Bidithal does to Felisin. He thinks how Bidithal has also offered vengeance against Karsa and to raise Silgar’s place. He hears Felisin weeping and thinks “That lass would no longer look upon him with disgust.”</span></p><p>SCENE 5</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.820947794907868">Earlier, L’oric’s tent had briefly glowed brightly. Now, at dusk, another burst of light occurs and L’oric entered from a portal covered in blood, carrying a “misshapen beast,” an “ancient demon.” Its cries of pain had been breaking L’oric’s heart and it’s with some relief they finally end as it dies. He grieves over its death and is angry at himself for allowing it, for “too long proceeding as if the other realms held no danger to them. And now his familiar was dead, and the mirrored deadness inside him seemed vast.” As he strokes its face, he tells it “ah my friend, we were more of a kind than either of us knew. No, you knew, didn’t you. Thus the eternal sorrow in your eyes . . . each time I visited. I was so certain of the deceit. So confident that we could go on undetected, maintaining the illusion that our father was still with us.” He recalls how he had killed all the T’lan Imass involved save for the clan leader, whom he swears to hunt down. He thinks, “I need help. Father’s companions. Which one? Anomander Rake? No. A companion yes, on occasion, but never Osric’s friend. Lady Envy? Gods, no Caladan Brood? But he carries his own burdens, these days. Thus, but one left.” He calls on T’riss in “Osric, my father’s name.” He finds himself in a walled garden speaking to T’riss, Queen of Dreams. She compliments him on his skill at hiding his “Liosan traits” and says all the Tiste have gotten good at such thinks, mentioning how Rake one spent nearly 200 years disguised as a human royal bodyguard. She tells him his father Osric “Sleeps. We all long ago made our choices . . . Behind us our paths stretch, long and worn deep. There is bitter pathos in the prospect of retracing them. Yet for those of us who remain wake, it seems we do nothing but just that. An endless retracing of paths, yet each step we take is forward, for the path has proved itself to be a circle. Yet—and here is the true pathos—the knowledge never slows out steps.” L’oric tells her the Malazans call it “wide-eyed stupid.” When he informs her that Kurald Thyrllan lost its guardian, she says, “Yes. Tellan and Thyr wren ever close and now more than ever,” which he thinks is a “strange statement that he would have to think on later.” She realizes he’s there to ask her to help find a new guardian and wonders how his “desperation urges you to trust where no trust has been earned.” He argues she was his father’s friend, but she replies: “Friend? L’oric, we were too powerful to know friendship. Our endeavors far too fierce. Our war was with chaos itself, and at times, with each other. We battled to shape all that would follow. And some of us lost that battle . . . I held no deep enmity for your father. Rather, he was as unfathomable as the rest of us.” However, she agrees to help, telling him it will take a while and that “the present vulnerability will exist in the interval. I have someone in mind, but the shaping towards the opportunity remains distant. Nor do I think my choice will please you.” Her expression suddenly changes and she dismisses him, saying, “Another circle has been closed—terribly closed,” pulling her hand from a pool of blood. He appears back in his tent, sends his powers out and senses Felisin crawling in the night towards Karsa’s grove. He finds her and says he’ll go to Sha’ik, but Felisin says no; Sha’ik still needs Bidithal, a sense of priority and self-sacrifice that horrifies L’oric. She also forbids him from telling Heboric or trying to kill Bidithal. He agrees to let her stay in the grove and bring her healing elixirs. He’s furious with everyone and himself: “We knew he wanted her. Yet we did nothing.”</span></p><p>SCENE 6</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.820947794907868">Heboric is in his tent after several days of imbibing the tea. He has a vision of a</span><br/>jade giant with a “resigned” looking expressions)flying by, then sees “scores more” emerging from a single point in the dark [lots of quotes coming up]</p><blockquote><p>Each has a unique posture, they range from perfect condition to battered into fragments</p><p>He thinks “an army” at first, then notes they are “unarmed, naked, seemingly sexless”</p><p>Their “perfection” makes him think they were never alive, thus “statues in truth”</p></blockquote><p>He turns to see where they are going and sees “a vast—impossibly vast—red-limned wound cut across the blackness, suppurating flames along its ragged edges. Grey storms of chaos spiraled out in lancing tendrils and the giants descended into its maw. One after another. To vanish. Revelations filled his mind. Thus the Crippled God was brought down to our world. Through this terrible puncture. And these giants follow. Like an army behind its commander. Or an army in pursuit.</p><p>He realizes they can’t all be appearing in his home realm because there are too few</p><p>He begins moving toward a giant, one that was “but torso and head.”</p><p>He can see into it: “Figures. Bodies like his own. Humans, thousands upon thousands, all trapped within the statue. Trapped and screaming, their faces twisted in terror . . . Mouths opened in silent cries—of warning, or hunger, or fear—there was no way to tell . . . He thought he understood now—they were prisoners, ensnared within the stone flesh, trapped in some unknown torment.”</p><p>He strikes the finger of another one and enters it. He:</p><blockquote><p>“…found himself amidst a crowd of writhing, howling figures . . . A prisoner. There were voices roaring through his skull . . . in languages he could not recognize . . . Then a string of words reached through the tumult . . . and he understood them.</p><p>‘You came from there. What shall we find, Handless One? What lies beyond the gash?’</p><p>Then another voice spoke, louder, more imperious. What god now owns your hands, old man? Tell me! Even their ghosts are not here—who is holding on to you? Tell me!’</p><p>‘There are no gods,’ a third voice cut in . . .</p><p>‘So you say . . . in your empty, barren, miserable world!’</p><p>‘Gods are born of belief, and belief is dead. We murdered it with our vast intelligence. You were too primitive—’</p><p>‘Killing gods is not hard. The easiest murder of all. Nor is it a measure of intelligence. Not even of civilization. Indeed, the indifference with which such death-blows are delivered is its own form of ignorance.’</p><p>‘More like forgetfulness. After all, it’s not the gods that are important, it is the stepping outside of oneself that gifts a mortal with virtue—’</p><p>‘Kneel before Order? You blind fool—’</p><p>‘Order? I was speaking of compassion—’</p></blockquote><p>One mentions only Heboric can leave but should do so soon while he can. Heboric looks at his missing left hand: “A god. A god has taken them. I was blind to that—the jade’s ghost hands made me blind to that.” He returns to his tent, thinking, “A god has found me. But which god?”</p><p>In them morning his hands are still “ghostly, but the otataral was gone. The power of the jade remained [with] slashes of black through it . . . barbs banded the backs of his hands. . His tattoos had been transformed.” His vision is now “inhumanly sharp” and then he realizes who the god is Treach: “In need of a Destriant, Treach? So you simply took one? Stole from him his own life . . . Is this how you recruit followers? Servants? By the Abyss, you have a lot to learn about mortals.” But his anger soon dies as he tests his heightened senses. He smells a hint of violence and blood, but dismisses it as some domestic argument. As he eats, “the burgeoning of some senses perforce took away from others. Leaving him blissfully unaware of his newfound single-mindedness. Two truths he had long known did not for some time emerge to trouble him. No gifts were truly clean in the giving. And nature ever strives for balance . . . a far grimmer equilibrium had occurred between the past and the present.”</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.820947794907868">In Karsa’s grove, Felisin is awakened by serpents slithering over her. She recalls Bidithal’s words during the cliterectemy: “‘I shall bring this ritual to our people, child, when I am the Whirlwind’s High Priest. All girls shall know this in my newly shaped world. The pain shall pass. All sensation shall pass. You are to feel nothing, for pleasure does not belong in the mortal realm. Pleasure is the darkest path, for it leads to the loss of control. And we mustn’t have that. Not among our women. Now you shall join the rest, those I have already corrected.’ Two such girls had arrived then, bearing the cutting instruments. They had murmured encouragement to her . . . spoken of the virtues that came of the wounding. Propriety. Loyalty . . . the withering of desire . . . Passions were the curse of this world . . . The lure of pleasure had stolen Felisin’s mother away from the duties of motherhood.” Felisin thinks it hadn’t been pleasure but “Hood who embraced her [Felisin’s mother].” She believes Felisin will kill Bidithal, though not yet and though it may be too long until it happens: “Bidithal takes girls into his arms every night. He makes an army, a legion of the wounded. . And they will be eager to share out their loss of pleasure. They are human after all and it is human nature to transform loss into a virtue. So that it might be lived with, so that it might be justified.” Karsa’s gods awaken and Ber’ok speaks to her: “Vengeance swarms about you, with such power as to awaken us . . . We would ease your pain . . . You seek vengeance? . . . The one who has damaged you would take the power of the desert goddess for himself . . . the [Felisin’s] wounding is of no matter. The danger lies in Bidithal’s ambition A knife must be driven into his heart . . . Serve us and we in turn shall serve you . . . We shall ensure that Bidithal’s death is in a manner to match his crime, and that it shall be timely.” When Felisin asks how she is to be the knife, Ber’ok answers, “Child, you already are.”</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Fourteen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>A dozen wolves are pacing Karsa as he moves through the snow-covered mountains. Expecting attack, Karsa is surprised when the wolves speak to him in Malazan. He realizes it is a D’ivers and threatens them, saying he’s killed others. They say they no longer are interested in killing him, but want to warn him that he is on the trail of two people and they worry that should he cross one of them “the world will come to regret it.” He says he has no interest in fighting but can’t be responsible for what happens if he is crossed himself. The wolves reply that he should tell them “that Ryllandaras sought to dissuade you. Before you make your last living act one that sees this world destroyed.” Karsa considers it a “potent” warning and when Bairoth asks what he will do now, Karsa says, “I would meet these dire travelers of course.”</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Karsa calls Ryllandaras’ words “portentous” and Bairoth says they were that, but “absurdly so. There are no powers . . . that pose such absolute threat. Spoken through the frenzied current of fear. Likely personal in nature.” Delum, however, is troubled, and reminds Karsa that the D’ivers was powerful and he advises caution. He finds a road and stops to sleep. He wakens and he hears rocks being moved from far ahead. He eventually catches up to the noise: a rockslide had buried half a city and one person was clearing rocks while another was sitting on a rock eating (Icarium and Mappo). Mappo speaks firs, offering Karsa some food, saying the mountain goat he was eating had fallen from the cliff: “You always see them scampering and clambering way up there, and so you naturally believe they never make a misstep. Well, another delusion shattered.” Icarium and Karsa eye each other for a long moment, then Icarium continues digging his way into the buried city. Mappo introduces himself and Icarium and Karsa says that name has appeared in his people’s legends. Mappo comments at this meeting: “A Trell, a Jhag, and a Thelomen Toblakai and we each are likely the only one of our respective kinds in all of Seven Cities.” He adds he’s heard of Karsa as Sha’ik’s bodyguard. Karsa asks if that makes them enemies and Mappo says not unless Karsa chooses so, though he advises against it. Karsa says Mappo isn’t the first to offer such counsel, saying a group of wolves did the same, though he doesn’t know or care what makes the pair so allegedly dangerous; if they get in his way he’ll just kill them. Mappo asks if they have reason to do so, and when Karsa says it’s up to them and Mappo responds then it would be best if they stay ignorant. He adds, though, that they already know a lot about Karsa: he’s formidable based on the Soletaken skin he wears (one belonging to someone Mappo and Icarium know though weren’t friends with), he has ghosts—both his two kinsmen next to him but also the “appallingly numerous” ones who trail behind him and “whose hatred for you is a palpable hunger” leading Mappo to conclude Karsa has been cursed. Mappo talks of convergence then, telling Karsa that “when curses collide . . . singular purpose. Powers and wills are drawn together, as if one must by nature seek the annihilation of the other. Thus, you and Icarium are now here, and we are moments from a dreadful convergence.” Icarium emerges then and tells Icarium he has traveled far to die. Karsa asks why he talks so much if he’s so eager and Icarium answers “I am never eager. This is a moment of pathos, I believe. The first time I have felt such a thing.” He asks Mappo if they have had these kinds of moments before and Mappo says yes. Icarium and Karsa face off and Icarium immediately (and shockingly quickly) breaks Karsa’s sword. Karsa punches Icarium and Icarium goes unconscious. Mappo then knocks Karsa out from behind, then looks at the two and says, “Better than I could have hoped for I think.”</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Karsa wakes alone. He checks out where Icarium had been digging and finds a black statue of a seven-headed hound.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Six days later, he’s reached a small village with a tower in its center. As he crosses fields at night, he thinks, “The notion of a life spent tilling fields was repellent to the Teblor warrior. The rewards seemed exclusive to the highborn landowners, whilst the laborers themselves had only a minimal existence, prematurely aged and word down by the continuous toil. And the distinction between high and low status was born from farming itself . . . Wealth was measured in control over other people and the grip of that control could never be permitted to loosen. Odd, then, that this rebellion had had little to do with such inequities . . . [was] little more than a struggle between those who would be in charge. Yet the majority of the suffering had descended upon the lowborn, the common folk. What matter the color of the collar around a man’s neck, if the chains linked to them were identical? . . This blood-soaked Apocalypse was pointless, a misdirected explosion of fury that when it passed left the world unchanged.” He comes across a pit filled with garbage and the bones/bodies of the killed Malazans. Delum tells him a “place of haunting” is ahead, and Bairoth adds that the place is damaged, but the Elder power lingers.” He passes to the center of a group of barrows and to a stone ring. Bairoth tells him it is the burial place of a shaman and it offers a path via the dreamworld to greatly shorten the time of their journey. His two friends say they can guide him as they are between life and death and Hood cannot find them, which is partly why Hood hates Karsa, because “you have taken and would not give to him. Will not. Would you become your own Keeper of Souls. So he must now fear. When last did Hood know a rival?” Karsa says he’d break the chains and free his ghosts if he knew how and when Bairoth says his two friends would rather he didn’t, Karsa replies the two are probably the only ones who feel that. He then thinks “To cast of my enemies, I must also cast off my friends. And so Hood follows, and waits. For the day that must come.” Karsa enters the warren which begins as Tellann and then becomes Jaghut, and Bairoth tells him it is the border between two warring races, adding Karsa has already reached near the beginning of the Jhag Odhan. As he walks he passes rocks with bodies pinned beneath them and when Delum asks if he’ll free them, Karsa says no. Deluth tells them the bodies are not Forkrul Assail and while some are dead “many remain alive and will not die for a long time . . . do you no longer believe in mercy?” Karsa says he will not “undo what I do not understand.” He comes across a field of ice and bones and a tower. He enters it and finds a Jaghut female pinned. He notes the army didn’t kill her and she corrects him to say it couldn’t, at least no immediately, but the Tellann Ritual is slowly destroying the Omtose Phellack, which will mean the death of the Jhag Odhan. Karsa realizes it also will mean her own death and when he says she speaks as if the death of the Odhan is more important than her own, she says it’s because it is: “On the Jhag Odhan, the past lives still. Not just my fallen kin, the Jhag—the few that managed to escape the Logros T’lan Imass. There are ancient beasts . . . that have died out everywhere else, mostly on the spears of the T’lan Imass.” He asks if that includes horses and she says yes, there are a few feral ones, though many have been killed off by hunting Trell. Karsa asks why she didn’t stop the Trell and she says she was hiding, but was found by an Imass scouting party of eight, which she destroyed all of save one. Karsa says, “Enemies should be killed, not imprisoned” and adds he senses nothing evil of her. She tells him it’s been a while since she’s heard that word; “in the wars with the T’lan Imass, that word had no place.” Karsa declares he must answer injustice,” and frees her, despite the High Tellann sorcery. She is shocked at his ability and calls it “ignorance, honed into a weapon.” She asks how she can repay her and he answers with a Jhag horse and further talk of the seven T’lan Imass she destroyed. She, Aramala, tells him she will do so, then informs him she will free the half-bloods that are imprisoned and asks if he is curious at what the non-Jhagut half is. He frowns at that and she says there is much she has to tell him.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Karsa emerges from the warren at the edge of the Jhag Odhan. As he makes his way he finds he is walking through vast flint mines. Karsa thinks “IN this single valley, an entire army could have fashioned its weapons of stone,” and Bairoth tells him “you circle the truths as a lone wolf circles a bull elk.” Karsa enters a large cave and within it a large cavern where he sees a huge projection of pure flint. Beyond is another cavern filled with stone weapons: “hundreds upon hundreds . . . the next niche contained the same . . . Twenty-two chambers in all. The weapons of the dead. The weapons of the failed.” He calls upon the Seven and tells them he has delivered them here. Urugal appears and says, “You have found that which was taken from us, Karsa Orlong. You have freed your gods . . . you have found our weapons.” Karsa mentions the weapons might not be there and Urugal says “They did not fail us,” and when Karsa replies “But the Ritual did,” Urugal says “You understand then.” He informs Karsa that the Seven’s physical bodies are coming, held together “only by our wills,” though Karsa corrects him to add “and the one you now serve. “Urugal says it is time for Karsa’s reward and Siballe interjects, telling Karsa that the Seven have gathered the sacrificed Teblor into an army for Karsa to lead against the lowlanders. Karsa replies “I shall” and Urugal says the Seven gods of the Teblor will not become the Eight. Halad steps up to tell Karsa they will teach him how to make a flint sword for himself, but Karsa says he already knows. He moves to the massive projection of pure flint, but the Seven say none of the T’lan Imass have never been able to draw out a large flake from it, which is why they abandoned it. They suggest he try one that isn’t impossible, but Karsa rejects their advice. When he displays strange knowledge of stone and flint, Urugal demands how he came by such knowledge and Karsa replies: “Foolish Teblor. Or so you believed. So you would have us. Fallen Thelomen Toblakai, but he who has fallen can rise once again. Thus you were once T’lan Imass. But now you are the Unbound . . . From wandering to hold, from hold to house.” He moves up and prepares to strike a flake and thinks to his two friends: Hear me when none other can. One day, I shall break my chains, I shall free the souls that now hound me. You would not be among them, or so you have said. Nor would I wish Hood’s embrace upon you . . . I have fashioned an alternative.” Bairoth answers that see his intent and are impressed by his “genius,” they will accept the alternative. Their ghosts flow into the flint to find a shape, then he strikes and catches a shard of flint nearly as tall as he is. Watching, Halad whispers, “You surpass us.” Urugal says they will invest the weapon so it can’t break and Karsa is fine with that, but when Urugal continues that Karsa will become the Eight God, Karsa rejects him: “I man not as you Urugal. I am not Unbound. You yourself closed the chains about me. By your own hands you saw to it that the souls of those I have slain will pursue me eternally. You have shaped my haunting, Urugal. Beneath such a curse, I can never be unbound.” Urugal tells him there is a place for him anyway in the House of Chains, and Karsa says he knows—”Knight of Chains, champion of the Crippled God.” Surprised, Urugal says, “You have learned much,” to which Karsa, looking at his hands bloodied by catching the flint shard, says, “I have, T’lan Imass. As you shall witness.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Fifteen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Fiddler and his squad are scouting an army of 3000 trailing them, different and larger than the harassing raiders they’ve dealt with for several weeks. Fiddler sends off a message to Tavore to prepare for a fight, then as he looks more closely at the 3000 he begins to wonder. Fiddler’s group is surprised by the new army, but rather than attack, the strangers wait for Tavore to arrive. As Tavore, Gamet, and Temul ride to meet them (Temul seems to recognize them), the chieftain of the strangers tells Fiddler his group has taken care of the raiders that have been attacking the Fourteenth. Tavore arrives and the chief is introduced as Gall, leader of the Burned Tears of the Khundryl. He recalls for them how the Khundryl met Coltaine (Blackwing to them): “My warriors sought to challenge, to see who were the greatest warriors of all . . . we were humbled. Blackwing is dead, his clan destroyed, and Korbolo Dom’s Dogslayers dance on his name. That must be answered, and so we have come . . . We are changed . . . other than we once were. We grieve the loss of ourselves, and so we shall remain lost, for all time.” He asks to join and fight with the Fourteenth and when Tavore wonders if they seek revenge on Dom, Gall answers yes, but that isn’t why they are here; they’ve come to “make amends” for simply riding away and not fighting with Coltaine at the end. Tavore welcomes him and Fiddler and Cuttle think this may actually give them a chance. Gall then rides to Temul, hands him his broken sword and kneels before him, saying, “We are not Wickans . . . but this I swear, we shall strive to be.” Temul freezes, not knowing what to do, and Fiddler signals him some advice. Temul tells Gall he accepts the Burned Tears as “of the Crow Clan, of the Wickans.” Fiddler thinks Temul has just solved his problem with the old Wickans. Tavore invites Gall to a “modest” meal, and Gall says they’ve brought food and tonight will be a feast. Cuttle and Fiddler realize that while Temul’s problem is solved, Tavore’s problem—being in Coltaine’s shadow—just got worse.</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>The camp is celebrating. Gamet enters Tavore’s tent where Tavore and Gall remain after the commanders meeting. Gamet tells Tavore the army is drunk and Gall responds, “Like us, your army is lost.” Gamet explains how young and untested they are and Gall changes his analysis to “not yet found.” Gamet asks if Gall regrets his decision and Gall tells him his shaman’s have foretold something of Tavore’s army: “The Fourteenth shall know a long life, but it shall be a restless life. You are doomed to search, destined to ever hunt for what even you do not know, nor, perhaps, shall you ever know.” Gall rejects the idea of divination or of destiny. When Gall asks what about the Deck, Gamet says he’s not one of those who puts much stock in it. Gall wonders if Gamet doesn’t notice the patterns, cycles of history: “The past is all patterns, and those patterns remain beneath our feet, even as the stars above reveal their own patterns . . . the past lies beneath and above the present.” Tavore asks what they’ll find the next day at Vathar Crossing, and Gall answers it’s for her to decide, calling it a “place of death.” Gamet feels odd, out of place, thinks how drunken oblivion is like “a small temporary death.” He exits the tent, thinking he’s too old for the war. He sees a massively scarred cattle dog walk by and then Keneb walks after it, saying he’s taken to following it. He tells Gamet the dog survived the Fall though it should not have, impaled as it was by several spears. When Gamet asks how it survived then, Keneb replies Gesler found it and another dog and then the two dogs recovered from what they shouldn’t have. He adds that Gesler himself, along with Stormy and Truth are another mystery due to their strange skin color and connection to the Silanda. Gamet asks if they’ve made a pace with a god, which is forbidden in the Malazan armies. Keneb says he doesn’t know and has no evidence. Gamet tells him he finds all this disturbing, the lack of trust Keneb has for his own soldiers. Keneb answers they don’t trust him either, due to a rumor he abandoned his soldiers when the uprising began. He adds that he did not, responding to Gamet’s unspoken question, but he admits some of what he did might call his loyalty to the empire into question, explaining nothing mattered more than his family. But Gamet interrupts and says he’d prefer not to know the details, though he does ask about Keneb’s family. When Keneb mentions he managed to save them with help for Kalam, Gamet is surprised. He tells Keneb to keep an eye on Gesler, but at some point they’ll have to see if they can trust him. Listening to the cattle dog wandering nearby, Keneb tells Gamet he believes it’s looking for Coltaine, to which Gamet says the dog must be blind and or dumb to miss the fact that Coltaine is right here.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Fiddler sits by the fire with the other cattle dog—Roach. He’s lonely and miserable and wondering why Keneb is punishing them by marching them at the back of the army in the dust. He thinks that now with the Burned Tears, the army doesn’t actually need him anymore. And also that he doesn’t really want to return to Raraku: “I hated it the first time. I’m . . . not what I once was. Did I really think I could recapture something in that holy desert? . . . That charging momentum that belongs to the young? . . Revenge [is not] filling my belly like it used to—Hood knows, nothing does anymore. Not revenge. Not loyalty. Not even friendship. Damn you Kalam, you should have talked me out of it.” The other cattle dog appears and then Fiddler calls out for Gesler to join him. Gesler sits across from him and tells Fiddler he, Stormy, and Truth can’t get drunk any more, calling it a curse. He says they can’t sleep now because they’re not looking forward to seeing Vathar Crossing again. After some silence, Gesler asks if Fiddler is thinking about running, saying it’s bad, losing friends, wondering why you’re the one left: “Then what? Nothing. You’re not here, but wherever you are, you’re still there.” Fiddler tells Gesler it isn’t just losing the Bridgeburners; it’s about doing soldiering all over again: “There’s got to come a point, Gesler, when it’s no longer the right place to be, or the right thing to do.” Gesler says “Maybe, but I ain’t seen it yet. It comes down to what you’re good at,” and he asks what Fiddler would do instead. When Fiddler mentions he once apprenticed as a mason, Gesler interrupts and tells him apprentices are ten years old. Fiddler’s too old to change: “There’s only one thing for a soldier to do, and that’s soldiering. You want it to end? Well, there’s a battle coming. Should give you plenty of opportunity . . . But that’s not the problem. It’s because now you’ve got a new squad and you’re responsible for ’em. That’s what you don’t like and what’s got you thinking of running.” Fiddler walks away. On the ridge a half-dozen wolves stand quiet after their howling. Fiddler hears singing and he goes to its source, finding Nil and Nether sitting with a bowl between them and butterflies fluttering around the bowl. Nil calls him closer and Fiddler is swarmed by butterflies so he can’t see. Inside he hears a presence speaking to him: “Bridgeburner, Raraku waits for you. Do not turn back now . . . I am of this land now. What I was before does not matter. I am awakened. We are awakened. Go to join your kin. In Raraku—where he will find you. Together, you must slay the goddess. You must free Raraku of the stain that lies upon it . . . The song wanders Bridgeburners. It seeks a home. Do not turn back.” The presence then the butterflies disappear. Nether and Nil are crying, upset the presence spoke to Fiddler and not them though they called it. They tell him it was Sormo E’nath. As he speaks to them he yells to them to “stop that damned singing,” and at their blank looks realized neither of them is singing, thought the song is filling his head. He heads back to camp, thinking, “Sormo had not words for them. Nor did he. Nor did he want to see their faces—their helpless desperation, their yearning for a ghost that was gone—gone forever. That was not Sormo E’nath. That was something else—Hood knows what. ‘We are awakened.’ What does that mean? And who is waiting for me in Raraku? My kin—I’ve none barring the Bridgeburners—gods below! Quick Ben! Kalam! One, or both?” The sun starts to rise and the wolves begin howling.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Gamet begins the descent with the army toward the crossing, noting the bones and bits of cloth and iron in the ground, and all the detritus of the old battle. Long poles rise out of the mud and water, adorned with carcasses of sheep and goats, maggots falling from them into the river. Keneb joins him, pointing out the blood amidst the flotsam. Keneb and Gamet believe the offerings are to welcome the Fourteenth, though Keneb thinks if so the tribes are crazy: “This notion of seeing the world metaphorically has ever driven me to distraction. The Seven Cities native sees everything differently. To them, the landscape is animate—not just the old notion of spirits, but in some other, far more complicated way.” When Gamet asks if it’s worth thinking of, Keneb points out if the Malazans could have better read the signs, they would have seen the uprising coming. Tavore, overhearing, tells him “sometimes, knowledge is not enough.” Tavore orders the sappers forward to blow up “a bridge of detritus held in place by blood.” Tene Baralta tells Gamet the tribes will consider it an insult, but Gamet says Tavore is aware of that, but the footing is too unsure, something the tribes would certainly know. Baralta suggest Gall sends out a rider to meet with observers just to make sure. When Gamet says it’s a good idea, Baralta goes off to do so. Keneb points out that Tavore probably wouldn’t like that the two made that decision on their own. Gamet tells him he’s right and heads back to Tavore. He sees Nil and Nether kneeling in the water near her and thinks, noting that and Tavore’s obvious anger: “Aye, they cling still to the chains, and it seems letting go is the last thing they would do, given the choice.” Out loud, he announces “I see the children are playing in the mud . . . I advise we assign a minder to them, lest they injure themselves in their exuberance. After all, Adjunct, I doubt the Empress intended you to mother them, did she?” Tavore answers, “No, they were to be my mages” and after a bit more back and forth, gives Gamet leave to act in her place. He grabs the two by their shirts and yanks them upright, then shakes them, telling Tavore, “This is what a Wickan grandmother would have done.” Nil and Nether go from anger to sulking and Tavore tells them someone should make contact with any observers to make sure they don’t take blowing up the bridge the wrong way. Gamet tells her Baralta suggested the Khundryl and she says both can do it, and sends the two warlocks to Baralta. When they’re gone, she tells Gamet to tell Baralta that next time he should bring his suggestion to her personally.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Cuttle and Fiddler return from setting the munitions. They blow it and the ford clears. Cuttle tells Fiddler it’s good he didn’t run. Keneb tells them good job and gives Fiddler’s squad the privilege of first crossing. Fiddler doesn’t feel the usual pleasure because “the broken song whispered on in his mind, a dirge lying beneath his every thought.” When Cuttle tells him “the way ahead seems clear,” Fiddler thinks, “Doesn’t mean I have to like it.”</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>The army continues to cross as Gamet and Tavore climb the butte on the other side. From the summit, they look down on the city of Ubaryd, its harbor crowded with Nok’s ships, which have retaken the city. Tavore points out the Whirlwind in the distance. She asks if Gamet thinks Sha’ik will contest their approach and when Gamet says she’d be foolish not to, Tavore wonder if Sha’ik wouldn’t rather face untested recruits. Gamet calls that a big gamble, saying just the march will harden the soldiers. He says if he were she, he’d rather face a bruised army, adding harassing them will also give Sha’ik knowledge of Tavore’s tactics. Right now, he says, Sha’ik cannot take the measure of Tavore. Tavore agrees, saying, “Curious, isn’t it? Either she is indifferent to me, or she feels she has already taken my measure—which of course is impossible. Even assuming she has spies in our army.” Gamet is struck that he’d never even considered that possibility. The two are silent as the sun goes down and the Whirlwind “held its own fire.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Sixteen</strong></p><p>SCENE 1</p><p>Kalam has been in Pust’s temple for over a week and is itching to move on, now that’s he’s delivered the diamonds and is healed. He hears singing and thinks Mogora’s voice is grating. Pust gives him a few of the diamonds and says he can go, telling him to “breach the Whirlwind—into the heart of Raraku.” Kalam asks how he can do that without being detected and Pust says with his help: “High Priest and Master of Rashan and Meanas and Thyr”</p><p>SCENE 2</p><p>Kalam and Pust exit a warren near the Whirlwind. Kalam asks Pust what that singing is, realizing it hasn’t been Mogora all along as he’d thought. Put tells him he can’t hear any singing, then, in one of his “monologues” says it’s “the Tanno song.” Kalam asks how they’ll enter the Whirlwind without the goddess knowing and Pust tells him they’ll use “misdirection.” The azalan demon appears, swoops up Kalam, and breaks through the whirlwind, tossing Kalam into a crevice in the ruins of a city, then running out again. Kalam, noting he can no longer hear the song, settles in to wait.</p><p>SCENE 3</p><p>Cutter, carrying Apsalar, heads out on the trail leading to the ships. Cotillion is standing amidst the many corpses, but looking at one in particular—the old with who had been burned. Cutter is surprised by the god’s expression: “the ravaged look that made him suddenly appear twenty years older.” Cutter asks if Cotillion knew the woman and Cutter says her name was Hawl and adds, “I’d thought Surly had taken them all out. None of the Talon’s command left. I thought she was dead . . . I made them good at hiding . . . Good enough to hide even from me, it seems.” When Cutter asks what she was doing here, Cotillion says the real question is why was she with Traveler. He wonders first if Traveler knew who she was, then answers his own question with of course Traveler did. He pulls the talon off Hawl and tosses it to Cutter, telling him to go to the Edur ship and that Cotillion is sending them to meet another “agent of ours” to wait there in case they’re needed to “take down the Master of the Talon.” Cutter inquires if Cotillion knows where that Master is and the god replies, “I have a suspicion. Now, finally, a suspicion about all of this.” He picks up Hawl in his arms and walked away, but not before pointing out the similarity between himself and Cutter at that moment. Cutter yells after him “it’s not the same. It’s not! We’re not…“ Cotillion disappears into shadow and Cutter heads for the ship.</p><p>SCENE 4</p><p>Cotillion reaches a glade and puts Hawl down gently. Shadowthrone appears. After some silence, Cotillion tells him Traveller is in the Edur ruins and Shadowthrone says Traveller is too stubborn to answer any of their questions. He confirms it is Hawl, then says “How many times do our followers have to die, Cotillion? Then again, she clearly ceased being a follower some time ago.” When Cotillion tells him she thought they were dead and gone, Shadowthrone says she was right, “in a way.” Cotillion agrees, but says, “not in the most important way . . . she was a friend.” Shadowthrone says “Ahh, that most important way” then asks if Cotillion will pursue the matter. Cotillion says yes, they seem to have little choice in finding out what the Talon is up to and stopping them. Shadowthrone says “No, friend. We need to ensure that they fail.” Cotillion tells him he’s realized who is masterminding the whole thing and he’s sent Cotillion and Apsalar there. When Shadowthrone asks if they’ll be enough, he says no, he has other agents there. He wants Apsalar close just in case something goes wrong. Shadowthrone asks where all this is and when Cotillion answers Raraku, Shadowthrone grins and says “Ah, dear Rope, time’s come, I think, that I should tell you more of my own endeavors.” Cotillion says he’d been wondering about those diamonds he’d given Kalam. Shadowthrone tells Cotillion they should bring Hawl home and talk, adding being so close to Traveler makes him nervous. They exit.</p><p>SCENE 5</p><p>Cutter reaches the damaged ships and as he looks upon them, Apsalar comes to. He tells her Darist was killed, along with all the Edur, thanks to Traveler. She says, “I felt him. Such <em>anger</em> . . . Dancer knew him. Knew him well. They were three. It was never just the two of them . .. just Dancer and Kellanved. No, he was there. Almost from the very beginning. Before Tayschrenn, before Dujek, before even Surly.” He informs her they are on another task for Cotillion and she tells him “Do not walk this path, Crokus.” He says he thought she’d “appreciate the company.”</p><p>SCENE 6</p><p>Pearl identifies where he and Lostara are as the Pan’potsun Hills. They’ve been traveling for several days. Pearl wants a buried city to perform a ritual to open a sorcerous trail and Lostara tells him they’re standing on top of one. He performs a ritual, speaking to the ghost of local earth spirit. Pearl leads them to a flat area where they find the wreckage of a trader’s wagon, bones, and a burned circle. Pearl tells them the bones are from rats that were part of a Di’vers named Gryllen, who seemingly was badly harmed in this area. He walks over to a heap of ash and uncovers it to reveal the gnawed bones of a corpse, pulling out a melted piece of metal he thinks is a Malazan badge—mage cadre. They uncover one of the four remaining ash heaps to find another corpse. This one opens its eyes and speaks, telling them its name is Clam and it dies a horrible death before becoming Gryllen’s porter. Pearl tells Lostara the sorcery animating Clam is fading, leading him to think Gryllen is far away or dead. He also says the warren of fire that was used here has left a trail they can follow. Lostara, though, says it’s too dark and they should camp for the night. He tells her the trail isn’t far and so she agrees to follow. Soon they come to another, larger, burned corpse. Pearl tells Lostara “Hood was here . . . The god himself came to take this man—not just his soul—but also the flesh—all that had been infected by the warren of fire—the warren of light, to be more precise . . . There’s been a change in Hood’s household.” When Lostara asks what this has to do with their quest for Felisin, Pearl replies: “Remember Stormy’s tale . . . Heboric, Kulp, and Baudin. We found what was left of Kulp back at Gryllen’s wagon. And this . . . is Baudin. The damned Talon . . . Remember their strange skin? Gesler, Stormy, Truth? The same thing happened to Baudin . . . That warren changed them.” Lostara figures out the timeline and deduces that Felisin and Heboric are with the Apocalypse army in Raraku: “Think man. Felisin’s hatred of the Malazan Empire must be all-consuming. Nor would Heboric hold much love for the empire that imprisoned and condemned him. They were desperate, after Gryllen’s attack . . . and probably hurting.” Pearl nods in agreement, then asks why Lostara’s attack on Sha’ik with the Red Blades failed. She answers it didn’t; they killed her. When he asks who then is commanding the uprising, she says she doesn’t know. He asks to see the ambush sight and she agrees to take him in the morning.</p><p>SCENE 7</p><p>Onrack is flooded by memories—”what had lain within . . . layered, indurated by countless centuries, was a landscape Onrack could read once more.” He looks at the setting and rather than the mesas and sand, sees it as it once was: an inland sea, reefs. He sees Imass—Renig Obar’s clan—walking down the strand to trade whale ivory and dhenrabi oil. The cold weather, perhaps, “hinted of something darker. A Jaghut, hidden in some fasthold, stirring the cauldron of Omtose Phellack.” This Onrack had stepped aside as Bonecaster for Absin Tolain, who was “far superior in the hidden arts and more inclined to the hungry ambition necessary among those who followed the Path of Tellann.” This Onrack had found his mind “drawn to other things. To raw beauty . . . he was not one for fighting, for rituals of destruction. He was always reluctant to dance in the deeper recesses of the caves, where the drums pounded and the echoes rolled through flesh and bone as if one was lying in the path of a stampeding herd of ranag—a herd such as the one Onrack had blown onto the cave walls around them. His mouth bitter with spit, charcoal, and ochre, the backs of his hands stained where they had blocked the spray from his lips, defining the shapes on the stone. Art was done in solitude . . . on unseen walls, when the rest of the clan slept . . . Onrack had grown skilled in the sorcery of paint out of that desire to be apart, to be alone. Among a people where solitude was as close to a crime as possible. Where to separate was to weaken. Where the very breaking of vision into its components—from seeing to observing, from resurrecting memory and reshaping it beyond the eye’s reach, onto walls of stone—demanded a fine-edged, potentially deadly propensity . . . And when you [young Onrack] broke the unwritten covenant and painted a truthful image of a mortal Imass, when you trapped that lovely, dark woman in time, there in the cavern no one was meant to find . . .you fell to the wrath of kin. Of Logros himself, and the First Sword. But he remembered the expression on the young face of Ono T’oolan, when he had first looked upon the painting of his sister. Wonder and awe, and a resurgence of an abiding love . . . He had never known if Kilava herself had gone to see the painting.”</p><p>Trull interrupts Onrack’s walk through memory, saying Onrack’s silence always make him nervous. Onrack tells him how he was supposed to be banished from his tribe the night before the Ritual for committing “a crime to which there was no other answer.” Instead, he says, that was interrupted by four Jaghut tyrants had joined in a compact and tried to destroy the land, “as indeed they have.” Onrack continues, telling Trull the night before he was to be banned, he was in the cavern where he’d committed his crime and some unknown woman came—not his wife who had been “among the first to shunt me, for what I had done, for the betrayal it meant.” He wonders in his mind if it was Kilava: “I will never know. She was gone in the morning . . . even as the Ritual was proclaimed . . . She defied the call—no, more horrible yet, she had killed her own kin, all but Onos himself . . . Was it her? Was there blood unseen on her hands? That dried, crumbled powder I found on my own skin, which I’d thought had come from the overturned bowl of paint. Fled from Onos, to me, I my shameful cave. And who did I hear in the passage beyond? Did someone come upon us?”</p><p>Trull says Onrack needn’t say more, and Onrack thinks were he mortal he’d be weeping, but Trull still sees his grief. Onrack changes the subject to tell Trull the trail of the renegades is fresh. When Trull says Onrack enjoys killing, Onrack answers “Artistry finds new forms, Edur. It defies being silenced.” He says though he can’t pursue freely, as he’s vowed to serve Trull. Trull agrees though, since the renegades are somehow involved in the corruption of Trull’s people. When he says Onrack can kill them once he’s spoken to them, Onrack says he thinks he is too damaged to do so, adding though that Monok Ochem and Ibra Gholan are still chasing him and Trull and so they can kill the renegades. He also says they are holding off dealing with Onrack in hope Onrack leads them to the renegades, whom they believe Onrack will join once he finds them. When Trull asks if Onrack would do that, Onrack replies only if Trull does.</p><p>SCENE 8</p><p>They walk through hills “where the T’lan Imass had broken the ice sheets, the first places of defiance. To protect the holy sites, the hidden caves, the flint quarries. Where the weapons of the fallen were placed. Weapons those renegades would reclaim. There was no provenance to the sorcery investing those stone blades . . .They would feed the ones who held them, provided they were kin to the makers—or indeed made by those very hands . . . Finding those weapons would give the renegades their final freedom, severing the power of Tellann from their bodies.” Trull asks about Onrack’s memories of betrayal and Onrack replies “Perhaps we are destined to repeat our crimes.” Trull inquires as to the nature of the crime and Onrack tells him “I trapped a woman in time. Or so it seemed. I painted her likeness in a sacred cave. It is now my belief that in so doing I was responsible for the terrible murders that followed, for her leaving the clan. She could not join in the Ritual that made us immortal, for my by hand she had already become so. Did she know this? Was this the reason for her defying Logros and the First Sword? There are no answers to that. What madness stole her mind . . . She was a Bonecaster, a Soletaken.” Trull realizes she wasn’t Onrack’s mate and says; “yet you loved her.” Onrack answers, “Obsession is its own poison.” Trull says he doesn’t accept the idea of being doomed to repeat one’s mistakes, believing that one’s experiences lead to lessons learned, to wisdom. Onrack points out he has just betrayed Monok Ochem and Ibra Gholan, and the T’lan Imass by not accepting his fate—the same crime he committed long ago. He says he always longed for solitude and was content by himself in the sacred caves, or in the Nascent. Trull asks about this moment, and Onrack replies, “When memories have returned, solitude is an illusion, for every silence is filled by a clamorous search for meaning.” Trull’s response is Onrack is sounding more and more mortal every day. Onrack answers “Flawed, you mean,” and Trull agrees, then points out what Onrack is about to do—return home.</p><p>SCENE 9</p><p>The Tiste Liosan are camped a ways away, “battered, but alive.” They’ve also been bitten by bloodflies, though they don’t know what they were, just that “those bites seemed to crawl, as if the insects had left something behind.” Malachar senses an air of “unwelcome” to this strange realm they’ve entered. Jorrude looks up from grieving and tells them the Guardian is dead, “our realm is assailed, but our brothers and sisters have been warned and even now ride to the gates.” He also tells them their mission to find the trespassers continues. He adds that he senses “the [nearby] presence of an old friend to the Tiste Liosan . . . The Maker of Time.” Malachar nods his head at the name, thinking “A friend of the Tiste Liosan indeed. Slayer of the Ten Thousand. Icarium.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Seventeen</strong></p><p>SCENE ONE</p><p>Karsa makes his flint sword, feeling his companions in it: “Bairoth Gild, whose cutting irony seemed to have somehow infused the weapon, as had Delum Thord’s fierce loyalty.” Done, he faces the Seven, now in their “battered, broken bodies” and carrying their own swords. Urugal tells him “We are now free of the Ritual’s bindings. The chains, Karsa Orlong, are broken.” Another informs Karsa his weapon has been invested with Tellann and will not break. Karsa, though, points out broken weapons in the caverns and Urugal admits “Elder sorcery . . . Inimical warrens. Our people have fought many wars.” Karsa asks which battle killed them but Urugal says it doesn’t matter: “We have known wars beyond counting, and what have they achieved? The Jaghut were doomed to extinction—we but hastened the inevitable. Other enemies announced themselves and stood in our path. We were indifferent to their causes, none of which was sufficient to turn us aside. And so we slaughtered them. Again and again. Wars without meaning, wars that changed virtually nothing. To live is to suffer. To exist—even as we do—is to resist.” Siballe picks up: “This is all that was learned . . . every creature that ever lived—all share the same struggle. Being resists unbeing. Order wars against the chaos of dissolution, of disorder. . This is the only worthy truth, the greatest of all truths. What do the gods themselves worship, but perfection? The unattainable victory over nature, over nature’s uncertainty. There are many words for this struggle. Order against chaos, structure against dissolution, light against dark, life against death. But they all mean the same thing.” Another continues: “The ranag has fallen lame. It is distanced from the herd. Yet walks on its wake . . . time will heal. Or weaken. Two possibilities. But the lame ranag knows naught but stubborn hope. For that is its nature. The ay have seen it and will close . . . . the ay attack all at once . . . Until the ranag is dragged down. And stubborn hope gives way, Karsa Orlong. It gives way, as it always must, to mute inevitability.” When Karsa says the Crippled God, their new master, would “harbor the lame beast . . . offer it a haven,” Urugal agrees and Siballe adds: “Perfection is an illusion . . . mortal and immortal alike are striving for what cannot be achieved. Our new master seeks to alter the paradigm, Karsa Orlong. A third force, to change for ever the eternal war between order and dissolution.” Karsa says “A master demanding the worship of imperfection,” and Siballe says “yes.”</p><p>Karsa tells them they are not gods, saying, “To be a god is to know the burden of believers. Did you protect? You did not. Did you offer comfort, solace? Were you possessed of compassion? Even pity? To the Teblor, you were slave-masters, eager and hungry . . . expecting cruel sacrifices—all to feed your own desires. You were the Teblor’s unseen chains. And you woman [Siballe] were the taker of children.” Siballe points out they were “imperfect” ones who would have died otherwise and argues the children don’t regret it. To what Karsa replies “No . . . the regret remains with the mothers and fathers who surrendered them. No matter how brief a child’s life, the love of the parents is a power that should not be denied. And know this Siballe, it is a power immune to imperfection . . . Worship imperfection you said. A metaphor you made real by demanding that those children be sacrificed. Yet you were—and remain—unmindful of the most crucial gift that comes from worship. You have no understanding of what it is to ease the burdens of those who would worship you. But even that is not your worst crime. No. You then gave us your own burdens.” When he asks Urugal what the Teblor had done to deserve that, Urugal says “You failed,” and Siballe adds “We too failed, once, long ago . . . Such things cannot be undone. Thus, you may surrender to it, and so suffered beneath its eternal torment. Or you can choose to free yourself of the burden . . . our answer to you is simple: to fail is to reveal a flaw. Face that revelation . . . It is done. Celebrate it! That is our answer, and indeed is the answer shown to us by the Crippled God.” Karsa says he’ll now give his answer, and he cuts Siballe in half. The other six do nothing and Karsa tells them “Her army of foundlings will follow me . . . You will leave my people—leave the glade. You are done with us . . . If you ever appear before me again, I will destroy you . . . You used us. You used me. And for my reward what did you just offer? . . . . A new set of chains. . . .Get out.” They leave Karsa alone with Siballe, who is still sentient. She asks if he’ll leave her there and when he asks if there is “no oblivion” for her, she answers, “long ago a sea surrounded these hills. Such as sea would free me to the oblivion you speak of.” When he asks of her master, she informs him the Crippled God has abandoned her—”it would appear there are acceptable levels of imperfection and unacceptable levels”—and Karsa says he is “another god that understands nothing of what it means to be a god.” He puts her head, shoulder, and arm into his pack and leaves the cavern, just as Trull and Onrack rise up at its entrance. He uses the flat of his sword to sweep them off the edge and leaves.</p><p>SCENE TWO</p><p>As they recover from their fall, Onrack senses the Tellann warren still active in the cavern and rushes into the cave then into the Tellann fire to fuse Siballe’s other arm to himself. Trull eventually catches up just as Onrack finishes, and Onrack tells him the renegades have just left and are close. They leave just as Trull realizes Onrack now has two arms.</p><p>SCENE THREE</p><p>Karsa enters the edge of the Jhag Odhan and feels a kinship with it: “Its scale matched his own in ways he could not define. Thelomen Toblakai have known this place, have walked it before me.” He kills a deer and as he continues comes across an emaciated Jaghut sitting in a circle of flattened grass beside a brazier. The Jaghut—Cynnigig—offers an exchange of deer meat for his cooking fire and Karsa agrees. Cynnigig then tells him Aramala contacted him and so he came to meet Karsa. He informs him that both he and Aramala had helped the T’lan Imass against the Tyrants. Cynnigig says he’s going to bring Karsa to another Jaghut—Phyrlis—who will summon the Jaghut horses—they will come to her because it was “by her hand and her will that the horses came into being.” They converse and at one point, Karsa tells Cynnigig “I care not for fame, I did once . . . I changed my mind.” Cynnigig explains how he hid using magic, but not Omtose Phellack since the T’lan Imass would have sensed it and there is no law that a Jaghut can only use Omtose. On a tangent, he mentions the Forkrul Assail: “saving us the bloody recourse of finding a Forkrul Assail to adjudicate, and believe me, such adjudication is invariably bloody. Rarely indeed is anyone satisfied. Rarer still that anyone is left alive. Is there justice in such a thing? Oh yes, perhaps the purest justice of all.” He continues in a torrent of words, discussing the “preening empires that have risen only to then fall . . .Pomposity choking on dust, these are cycles unending among short-lived creatures” and other things.</p><p>SCENE FOUR</p><p>Cynnigig takes Karsa to a lone huge tree atop a hill, telling him the tree is “An Elder species . . . A sapling when an inland sea hissed salty sighs over this land . . . Hundreds of thousands [of years old]. Once these were the dominant trees across most of the world. All things know their time, and when that time is past they vanish.” This one has not because Phyrlis is part of it: “The tree and all its branches were wrapped in spiders’ webs that somehow remained entirely translucent . . . and beneath that glittering shroud, the face of a Jaghut stared . . . the tree had indeed grown around her, yet a single shaft of wood emerged from just behind her right collarbone, rejoining the main trunk along the side of her head.” Cynnigig tells Karsa that Phyrlis was a baby when she and her mother were caught by T’lan Imass. Phyrlis was spitted on a spear that was then shoved into the ground and the spear took part of her life-spirit and was reborn as a tree, whose own life-spirit helped keep her alive. When Karsa asks what her connection is to the horses, she says her blood gives them their longevity, which is lucky since they breed too infrequently to maintain themselves. She is happy to hear Karsa’s news that his people still breed them, as the Odhan horses are being hunted to extinction by the Trell. When Karsa asks if she means people like Mappo, she says yes, “Mappo Runt, who travels with Icarium. Icarium, who carries arrows made from my branches. Who, each time he visits me, remembers naught of the previous encounter. Who asks, again and again, for my heartwood, so that he may fashion from it a mechanism to measure time, for my heartwood alone can outlive all other constructs . . . It would kill me [so] instead I bargain. A strong shaft for a bow. Branches for arrows.” Karsa wonders if she has no defenses and when she replies none do against Icarium, he tells her he fought him once and now that he has a better sword, the outcome will be different next time, a statement that causes some alarm to the Jaghut. She then calls for the horses, telling Karsa usually no more than a dozen or so come, but soon a herd of 10-15,000 arrives. Cynnigig tells Karsa they have come not in answer to Phyrlis’ call but to Karsa’s, though neither of the Jaghut knows how or why. Phyrlis tells him the horses can smell the bloodoil in him: “It courses in your veins Karsa Orlong. Bloodwood has not existed in the Jhag Odhan for tens of thousands of years. Yet these horses remember.” Karsa picks out a stallion and names him Havoc, and then the herd leaves. Cynnigig says he had never imagined Thelomen Toblakai horse warriors and asks Karsa why the Teblor haven’t conquered all of Genebackis. Karsa answers one day they will and he will lead them. Cynnigig says then he and Phyrlis have “witnessed the birth of infamy” to which Karsa replies in his mind “Witness? Yes, you are witness. Even so, what I, Karsa Orlong, shall shape, you cannot imagine. No one can.”</p><p>SCENE FIVE</p><p>Cynnigig sits with Phyrlis after Karsa has left. The two discuss how she did a good job disguising the remains of the Azath House under her. Cynnigig calls the T’lan Imass fools for driving the spear into a House’s ground, but Phyrlis says, “What did they know of Houses, Cynnigig? Creatures of caves and hide tents. Besides, it was already dying and had been for years. Fatally wounded. Oh, Icarium was on his knees by the time he finally delivered the mortal blow, raving with madness. And had not his Toblakai companion taken that opportunity to strike him unconscious . . .. ” Cynnigig finishes the thought, “He would have freed his father . . . [who] had no desire to be saved. And so the House died, weakening the fabric . . . ” Phyrlis finishes for him “sufficiently for the warren to be torn apart.” She asks if Cynnigig sensed the six T’lan Imass standing beyond the House walls and he said yes, “Servants of the Crippled God, now, the poor things. They would tell [Karsa] something . . . They possess knowledge with which they seek to guide the Thelomen Toblakai.” He thinks they stayed back because of the House, but she says the House is dead; it was Karsa they feared, not the House. Cynnigig says then perhaps they aren’t so foolish, those Imass.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Eighteen</strong></p><p>SCENE ONE</p><p>A memory belonging to Felisin of Tavore recreating with Paran’s toy bone and antler toy soldiers a classic battle when the Royal Untan army defeated the rebellious House of K’azz D’Avore. Tavore had taken on the role of D’Avore and was working through every possible way to attempt victory, though military scholars had long thought it impossible. Felisin never learned if Tavore had succeeded. She remembers Tavore as never really being a child, never really playing: “She had stepped into their brother’s shadow and sought only to remain there, and when Ganoes went off for schooling . . It was as if she had become his shadow, severed and haunting.”</p><p>SCENE TWO</p><p>Sha’ik looks out over the edge of the ruined city, where the harbor had once been, and now, where rise the remains of coral islands, ramps of hardened sand, a salt flat, bordering dunes. She imagines the placement of her army here where they will meet the Fourteenth, or so Dom plans. She thinks Tavore will once again be playing the role of D’Avore. Mathok stands nearby, her protector now that Karsa and Leoman are gone, though she doubts she needs one as far as Tavore as concerned: “The Whirlwind Goddess could not be breached undetected. Even a Hand of the Claw could not pass unnoticed . . . no matter what warren they sought to employ. Because the barrier itself defines a warren. The warren that lies like an unseen skin over the Holy Desert. This usurped fragment is a fragment no longer, but whole unto itself. And its power grows. Until one day, soon, it will demand its own place in the Deck of Dragons. As with the House of Chains, a new House, of the Whirlwind. Fed by the spilled blood of a slain army.” She imagines what then, with Tavore bent before her in surrender, “her legions a ruin behind her . . . shall I then remove my war helm? Reveal to her at that moment my face? We have taken this war . . . We have supplanted, you and I Tavore, Dryjhna . . . .for our own private apocalypse . . . . when I show myself to you. . . at that moment you will understand. What has happened. What I have done. And why I have done it.” She thinks executing Tavore would be too easy, that survival is the sentence, “staggering beneath the chains of knowledge, a sentence of not just living but living with.” She is joined by L’oric, whom she knows is not simply a mortal man as he is so able to completely hide from her and the goddess. She tells him Heboric has stayed in his tent refusing to see anyone for weeks now and notes L’oric was the last to speak to him, a fact which surprises L’oric. His reaction tell her Heboric’s actions have nothing then to do with whatever he and L’oric had discussed. In reply to her question as to why Heboric might be distressed, L’oric tells her he “grieves for your sacrifice,” which Sha’ik says she finds strange as he never thought much of her as Felisin. She asks which sacrifice in particular he mourns and L’oric says she’ll have to ask Heboric. She changes to subject to Korbolo Dom’s happiness with the battle setting. L’oric says that makes sense as Dom thinks he can make Tavore go where he wants as if Tavore were stupid, but L’oric wonders why Tavore would fight where Dom wants her to, adding there is “danger in trusting to a commander who wars with the aim of slaughter . . . [rather than] victory.” Sha’ik argues slaughter achieves victory but L’oric says Leoman long ago pointed out the error of “sequence” in that thinking-that “victory precedes slaughter, not the other way around.” Sha’ik demands to know why neither Leoman nor L’oric brought this up at the discussions and he laughingly points out Dom doesn’t “welcome” discussion. When Sha’ik says Tavore doesn’t either, L’oric labels that irrelevant: “Malazan military doctrine—something Coltaine well understood but . . . Pormqual lost sight of. Tactics are consensual. Dassem Ultor original doctrine . . . ‘Strategy belongs to the commander, but tactics are the first field of battle, and it is fought in the command tent.'” L’oric points out, though, that such a doctrine was predicated on good officers, a core of quality corrupted by the nobleborn infiltration of the officer corps. He goes on to say that Tavore’s personality will have some relevance as tactics come from strategy. He speaks of cold and hot iron, placing Coltaine and Dujek in the cold category but saying Tavore is unknown as of yet. When prompted to explain the idea further, he calls over Mathok to help. Mathok names the following as cold iron: Coltaine, Dujek, Nok, K’azz D’Avore, Inish Garn of the Gral. He continues: “Cold iron, Chosen One. Hard. Sharp. It is held before you and so you reach [and become stuck] . . . the warchief’s soul either rages with the fire of life or is cold with death. Korbolo Dom is hot iron, as am I. As are you . . . we must pray that the forge of Tavore’s heart blazes with vengeance.” Sha’ik says why must Tavore be hot iron and Mathok says, “for then we shall not lose.” Sha’ik is staggered by this and ask what happens if Tavore is cold iron instead. Mathok calls it the “deadliest clash of all,” and L’oric adds “cold iron defeats hot iron more often than not. By a count of three or four to one.” Sha’ik points out that Coltaine lost to Dom though, but Mathok tells her Coltaine and Dom fought nine major battles and Dom won only once, and that was with the help of Reloe and “Mael, as channeled through the jhistal priest, Mallick Rel.” Seeing Sha’ik’s panic, L’oric asks her if she knows Tavore, and if Tavore is cold iron and she nods yes to both. L’oric immediately asks Mathok who among the rebels is cold iron. Mathok replies that Karsa can be both cold and hot, and the only other one is Leoman, who is cold.</p><p>SCENE THREE</p><p>Corabb Tehnu’alas is introduced, the sixth son of a deposed Pardu chief who had been purchased and saved from a trio of Gral by Leoman. Since then he has sworn his life to Leoman and believes he knows him as well as any. He and Leoman are watching the Fourteenth’s outriders. They plan to attack this night, despite Sha’ik’s orders to the contrary.</p><p>SCENE FOUR</p><p>L’oric heads for Karsa’s grove, evading probes from the goddess, Febryl, Reloe, Bidithal. He had been surprised to find Sha’ik so “unprepared.” He had expected far worse questioning, especially about where Felisin was, though he wonders if perhaps she had no need to ask, already knowing the answer. An idea that chills him in its implication she may know as well then what Bidithal did to her, and may not care. He senses that the grove is invested, sanctified and hopes it might be a blind spot to the goddess. Though he also thinks Sha’ik is also blinded by her obsession with Tavore, an obsession which grows as Tavore nears; he worries that she is seemingly so afraid of Tavore, whom she clearly knows somehow. He finds Felisin in the grove. She asks him how one can tell Bidithal’s murdering cult from Dom’s and says she’s glad to be able to hid in the glade. She asks if Sha’ik inquired about her and L’oric says no. Felisin responds that “She knows then. And has judged as I have—Bidithal is close to exposing the plotters. They need him, after all, either to join the conspiracy or to stand aside . . . so Mother needs him to play out his role.” L’oric wonders if that is so, and Felisin says that would mean “The Whirlwind Goddess has stolen the love from her soul . . . she [Sha’ik] has been under siege for a long time . . . in any case, she was not my mother in truth . . . a chance occurrence.” L’oric tries to say Sha’ik was returned to the living, but Felisin laughs that off, saying she knows, as she’s sure L’oric, Leoman, and Karsa do, that “Sha’ik Reborn is not the same woman as Sha’ik Elder.” When L’oric says it doesn’t really matter, Felisin disagrees, saying she knew Sha’ik Elder, “knew the truth of her and of her goddess . . . that we are, one and all, nothing but slaves. We are the tools she will use to achieve her desires. Beyond that, our lives mean nothing to the goddess.” She continues that Sha’ik Reborn seemed different, but it seems the “goddess is too strong. Her will too absolute. The poison that is indifference, and I well know that taste L’oric. Ask any orphan and they will tell you the same. We all sucked at the same bitter tit . . . And now . . . every one of us here. We are all orphans . . . Bidithal, who lost his temple, his entire cult. The same for Heboric. Korbolo Dom, who once stood as an equal in rank with great soldiers . . . Febryl [who] murdered his own father and mother. Toblakai, who has lost his own people. And all the rest of us here L’oric—we were children of the Malazan Empire once . . . We cast off the Empress in exchange for an insane goddess who dreams only of destruction, who seeks to feed on a sea of blood.” When L’oric asks if he too is an orphan, she doesn’t bother to answer, “for they both heard the truth in his own pained words. Osric.” Felisin says that leaves only Leoman “unchained.” He tells her he thinks he convinced Sha’ik that Leoman was their last hope. As night falls, L’oric feels an “avid regard” from the two Toblakai carvings and Felisin says they do haunt one. L’oric says it is a mystery that the others are T’lan Imass and Felisin finishes his thought by saying yes, Karsa thought them gods, but Leoman had told her to say nothing to him, adding it would be “a fool indeed to step between Toblakai and his gods.” L’oric says there’s nothing simple about Karsa, to which Felisin replies, “Just as you are not simply a High Mage . .. . You must act soon, you know” and she tells him he needs to make his choices before they are made for him. He says the same could be said about her. They eat.</p><p>SCENE FIVE</p><p>Sha’ik tries to enter Heboric’s tent and is painfully thrown back by surprisingly powerful wards. She demands he open up and he lets her in: “She stepped forward. There was a moment’s pressure . . . [then] a sudden absence . . . bursting like the clearest light where all had been, but a moment earlier, impenetrable gloom. Bereft, yet free. Gods, free—the light.” She asks what he did and Heboric says the goddess isn’t allowed in his temple. She feels herself returning to herself, “all that I was. Bitter fury grew like a wildfire as memories rose . . . Beneth you bastard. You close your hands around a child, but what you shaped was anything but a woman. A plaything. A slave to you and your twisted, brutal world. I used to watch that knife in your hands . . . that’s what you taught me, isn’t it? Cutting for fun and blood. And oh, how I cut. Baudin. Kulp. Heboric.” Heboric mentions Treach and looking at him, she realizes his tattoos are different and notes his cat-eyes. When he calls her Sha’ik, she tells him not to: “I am Felisin Paran of House Paran . . . Sha’ik waits for me out there, beyond this tent’s confines.” Heboric asks if she wants to go back to the goddess and when she says she has no choice, he can only say “I suppose not.” She suddenly recalls Felisin Younger and how she hasn’t seen her for weeks. She asks where she is, telling him the goddess hasn’t told her when he says the goddess must know. She sees something that scares her in his eyes then and starts to ask what he knows, but he interrupts and pushes her toward the outside, telling her the two of them spoke of Tavore and Febryl and Bidithal and “all is well” then shoves her outside of his wards. She reverts to Sha’ik and thinks just what he’d told her. As she heads back to the palace, Heboric slips out of the tent toward Karsa’s grove.</p><p>SCENE SIX</p><p>Bidithal sits amongst shadow thinking of Febryl and how “even betrayers can be betrayed.” He believes Febryl and the other conspirators want the warren for themselves, though he doesn’t know why. He knows Sha’ik wants him to find out and he plans to, though he has goals beyond hers, including vengeance on “those foreign pretenders to the Throne of Shadow.” He feels a “they” coming closer, sensing them when he listens very carefully. He thinks “Rashan and Meanas. Meanas and Thyr. Thyr and Rashan. The three children of the Elder Warrens. Galain, Emurlahn, and Thyrllan. Should it be so surprising that they war once more? For do we not ever inherit the spites of our fathers and mothers? . . . But he had not understood the truth of what lay beneath the Whirlwind Warren, the reason why the warren was held in this single place and nowhere else. Had not comprehended how the old battles never died, but simply slept, every bone in the sand restless with memory.” He speaks to his army of shadows, closing his ritual chant, asking if they “remember the dark” then being asked in turn. As they depart, he shivers at “that almost inaudible call . . . They were getting close indeed. And he wondered what they would do when they finally arrived.”</p><p>SCENE SEVEN</p><p>Dom sits in his tent with his chosen eleven assassins, his whore “plied with enough durhang to ensure oblivion for the next dozen bells.” Five of his assassins used to kill for the Holy Falah’dan prior to the Malazan conquest; three were Malazans he gathered to counter the Claw when he had “a multitude of realizations, of sudden discoveries, of knowledge I had never expected to gain—of things I had believed long dead and gone.” He recalls how there used to be 10 such assassins, proving his need for them. The final three were from the tribes, one of the one whose arrow had killed Sormo E’nath. Dom tells them Reloe has chosen some of them for a “singular task that will trigger all that subsequently follows.” The rest will still have jobs to do, he adds, including guarding him that “fateful” night. He dismisses them then joins an obviously nervous Reloe in an adjoining part of the tent. Dom mocks Reloe’s anxiety, asking who do they have to be afraid of—”Sha’ik? Her goddess devours her acuity—day by day the lass grows less and les aware of what goes on around here. And that goddess barely takes note of us . . . L’oric? . . . . He is all pose and nothing more . . . Ghost Hands? That man’s vanished into his own pit of hen’bara. Leoman? He’s not here and I have plans for his return. Toblakai? I think we’ve seen the last of him . . . Bidithal—Febryl swears he almost has him in our fold . . . he is a slave to his vices, is Bidithal.” Reloe says it isn’t the ones they know he’s worried about; it’s the ones not in the camp, the ones the goddess may let through because she suspects Dom and Reloe of plotting. Dom’s first reaction is to dismiss the idea, then he realizes Reloe may have a point, but then he says the goddess would never risk letting in a Claw—”there’d be no way to predict their targets.” Reloe finally gets across to Dom he’s talking about the Claw making an offer to the goddess (through Topper) to let the Claw in to kill Reloe, Dom, and Febryl, as they’re the ones they form the greatest danger to the Empire’s army, but Dom still thinks it won’t happen, that the goddess won’t listen to any such offer, won’t listen to anyone who “refuses to kneel to her will.” Reloe says okay, but he’ll continue to act under his own beliefs. Dom says fine and dismisses him.</p><p>SCENE EIGHT</p><p>Korbolo’s whore, Scillara, is actually a plant by Bidithal. She thinks how the durhang helps her not feel pain when Dom mistreats her, and how Bidithal’s rituals help her as well by allowing her to avoid “the weakness of pleasure,” letting her remain indifferent to Dom’s “peculiar preferences” while faking enjoyment of them. She waits for him to sleep, aided by drops she’s put in his wine, then she exits the tent. The guards remark on her frequent visits to the latrines, her throwing up due to the durhang even as they grope her as they “steady” her. She thinks once she might have enjoyed it while being offended, but that is past, and thinks as well that “everything else in this world had to be endured, while she waited for her final reward, the blissful new world beyond death.” As she moves through camp, she recalls her mother as a camp follower of the Ashok Regiment, how her mother sickened and died after the Regiment was shipped overseas. She meets a young girl—one of many orphans sifting through the garbage and waste for salvage—and gives her a message for Bidithal. She also gives her coins, though both she and the girl know that this will anger Bidithal.</p><p>SCENE NINE</p><p>Heboric arrives in the grove to find Felisin and L’oric, noting “she’s healed well, but not well enough to disguise the truth of what’s happened.” He decides not to show himself, since if the two are hiding there they would try and talk him out of his plan, which is to kill Bidithal. But he begins to worry that his new role as Destriant to Treach will complicate things, cause a convergence or escalation of power if he attacks a priest in his sanctified temple. He decides to wait for a better opportunity, realizing he’ll have to keep his new role secret. He comes across a young girl carrying a bunch of dead rhizan and slips by her unnoticed he thinks. But the girl turns back after he leaves and says, “Funny man, do you remember the dark?”</p><p>SCENE TEN</p><p>Leoman and two hundred warriors attack the Malazan camp, Leoman employing a sort of primitive Molotov cocktail: clay balls filled with lamp oil and connected by a thin chain and thrown like a bola. As the Malazans regroup, Corabb is about to seemingly be skewered by a dozen crossbolts when his horse goes down, he flies off to dive into a tent wall, and then miraculously ends up somersaulting, landing on his feet, and spinning around just as his horse rolls back for him to jump onto while the Malazan watch him ride off stunned.</p><p>SCENE ELEVEN</p><p>Leoman and his men gather and he tells them the real point of the attack is about to start as the Malazan’s horse warriors set after them in pursuit, just as he planned.</p><p>SCENE TWELVE</p><p>Febryl sits watching the dawn. He thinks how “the goddess devoured. Consuming life’s forces, absorbing the ferocious will to survive from her hapless, misguided mortal servants. The effect was gradual . . . it deadened. Unless one was cognizant of that hunger.” He recalls how Sha’ik Reborn has once said she knew all about him, and had been able to speak to his mind, but now he notes she barely does so and he believes he had hardened his defenses so she no longer could, though he wonders if it was just that goddess had turned Sha’ik “indifferent.” He worries perhaps Sha’ik and/or the goddess knows his plans and worries too of Dom’s spies, though he has faith in Reloe since Reloe “had every reason to remain loyal to the broader scheme—the scheme that was betrayal most prodigious—since the path it offered was the only one that ensured Reloe’s survival. And as for the more subtle nuances concerning Febryl himself, well, those were not Kamist Reloe’s business . . . Even if their fruition should prove fatal to everyone but me.” He believes he need not be clever; he just needs to keep things simple. He is startled by Sha’ik’s sudden appearance. When he says he is there to greet the dawn as he does every day, she points out that due to the barrier’s opacity, he’s actually facing the wrong direction. She also says she wants to clarify something: “Few would argue that my goddess is consumed by anger, and so consumes in turn. But what you might see as the loss of many to feed a singular hunger is in truth worthy of an entirely different analogy . . . She does not strictly feed on the energies of her followers so much as proved for them a certain focus. Little different from that Whirlwind Wall out there, which while seeming to diffuse the light of the sun, in fact acts to trap it. Have you ever sought to pass through . . . . It would burn you down to the bone . . . you see how something that appears one way is in truth the very opposite way? Burnt crisp . . . One would need to be a desert-born, or possess powerful sorcery to defy that. Or very deep shadows.” Listening, Febryl thinks he has made the flaw of making “living simply . . . synonymous with seeing simply” and he has realized this too late.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Nineteen</strong></p><p>SCENE ONE</p><p>Gamet watches Tavore walk through the remains of the Seti wiped out by Leoman’s band last night, over 300 of them killed in the ambush. Gamet thinks how only the Wickans had shown the discipline that kept them from the ambush and also eventually allowed them to drive off Leoman, who was “too caged to see his force ensnared in an out-and-out battle.” Gamet worries Tavore’s horse will be stung by one of the hordes of wasps and end up getting her injured, though both the horse and Tavore seem to be moving fine through the carnage. Tavore rejoins Gamet and informs him that Leoman had left many of the Seti wounded, thinking the Malazans would get to them before they died: “Wounded Malazans are better than dead ones, after all.” Gamet wonders why Sha’ik didn’t send Leoman’s group out sooner to harass them, saying she could have bought another month’s time and faced a much weaker enemy. Tavore says she has no idea, and both wonder if their enemy is not as monolithic as they’d thought, that perhaps they are “a confused opposition, one at odds with itself.” Tavore tells him to put the marines out tonight, referencing a time when Dassem Ultor faced a similar situation. Gamet remembers and agrees with her, telling her he will command them himself, though she says it isn’t necessary.</p><p>SCENE TWO</p><p>Fiddler arranges a competition among the army involving the three kinds of Odhan scorpions, involving Gesler and Borduke in his “scheme” and the three agree to split the profits three ways. They randomly select and Gesler and Borduke feel sorry for Fiddler, as he ends up with the birdshit scorpion: “puny and flat and black and looking like its namesake.” Fiddler, though, smiles at his “bad luck” and shares a glance with Cuttle. The first battle is set for this night, which surprises Bottle and Tarr coming right after the army was just badly bloodied. But Fiddler knows they need to get their minds off of it. Fiddler let his group know he actually arranged to get “stuck with” the birdshit scorpion, though he won’t tell them why. As they discuss it, his people let him know they are on to the fact of who he really is, though they tell him they won’t let command know. Gamet, Keneb and Ranal join them and take Cuttle, Fiddler, Gesler, and Stormy off to inform them that they’d be needed for “Dassem’s answer” tonight. Keneb also tells Fiddler he’s betting on Birdshit and has told Gamet to do so as well. Gesler and Stormy start to smell a rat. Fiddler wonders if he should reconsider his opinion of Keneb.</p><p>SCENE THREE</p><p>Just before the scorpion battle, the three scorpions are examined to make sure they haven’t been altered in any way, such as via magic. When Gesler confirms Joyful Union, the birdshit scorpion, is fine, he adds, “even though I know there’s something about it I’m not seeing and I’m about to lose my life’s savings on the Sergeants’ Wager.” The battle begins and when Joyful Union enters the ring, the other two seem terrified. JU then raises the tail and splits into two small but incredibly fierce and fast scorpions that take no time at all to kill the others. Stormy cries out “Cheat” and tries to draw his sword, but Gesler and Truth hold him back and say they all checked out Joyful Union and swore it was fine. Cuttle tells Fiddler they’re rich. Fiddler then tells his group (and via the “word-line” communication the other marines) that they’re “about to become our own Joyful Union” as they set up the answer to Leoman.</p><p>SCENE FOUR</p><p>Fiddler begins unpacking munitions and his specially made crossbow, explaining to the impressed Cuttle how he and Hedge had designed it then had it made by a jeweler in Malaz City. He finishes and tells the others it’s time.</p><p>SCENE FIVE</p><p>Gamet tells Tavore he’ll be heading out to his men in a few minutes, though he won’t actually join them in battle until the fighting starts. She asks Nil and Nether if they’ve done their rituals and Nil says they’ve spoken to the spirits as ordered, but due to the warlock’s weakened powers, they could only talk to the spirits and not compel them. Nether chimes in that “this land’s spirits are agitated at this moment . . . something else is happening.” Gamet leaves, feeling a fog fall over him, “unease and confusion [that] he had heard [claimed] other commanders, but had not thought it would befall him.” He has begun to “doubt his ability to command.” He knows tonight will be the first real test of that command and wishes he had stayed home, “refused her insistence—dammit, her assumption—that I would simply accept her wishes.”</p><p>SCENE SIX</p><p>Corabb crouches with 800 other soldiers wondering at Leoman’s hesitation. He asks Leoman about it and Leoman says he is wondering “About the Empress. She was once Mistress of the Claw. It fierce potency . . . we have all learned to fear. Ominous origins, yes? And then, as Empress, there were the great leaders of her imperial military. Dujek Onearm. Admiral Nok. Coltaine. Greymane.” Corabb interrupts to point out that none of them are here and Leoman agrees, saying, “True. We face the Adjunct Tavore, who was personally chosen by the Empress.” Corabb gets the implication, but notes Laseen also picked Pormqual, Dom, demoted Whiskeyjack, assassinated (according to rumor) Dassem Ultor. Leoman takes Corabb’s point that she makes mistakes and he orders his men forward. Corabb hopes the spirits smile on him tonight.</p><p>SCENE SEVEN</p><p>Borduke’s squad is working on a hill, probably a barrow, digging and moving rocks while another group is doing the same on another barrow. Fiddler is nearby, worrying that maybe they’d cut it too close and annoyed by the loud clumsiness of Borduke’s squad.</p><p>SCENE EIGHT</p><p>Leoman spots the outlying pickets digging on the barrows and is pleased at how they’re stumbling around in the dark due to setting up so late and at how they’ve set up too far apart from each other to really support each other well. Corabb waits for the signal.</p><p>SCENE NINE</p><p>Gamet is in the empty marine camp, knowing the cutters and healers are getting ready. He knows it’s possible Leoman won’t take the path Tavore has left him so invitingly. A capemoth flutters in front of him and he worries it’s an omen.</p><p>SCENE TEN</p><p>The rebels attack. Corabb runs toward the barrows and sees an arrow strike a Malazan helm and knock it off, realizing it wasn’t sitting on top of an actual person. Then the marines rise up and munitions start falling</p><p>SCENE ELEVEN</p><p>Fiddler and Cuttle’s group are firing away. The raid has been stopped dead. Fiddler lets a munition loose over a hilltop to devastating effect on the other side it seems, then enemy warriors start pouring over the ridge and Fiddler calls on his men to fall back.</p><p>SCENE TWELVE</p><p>Corabb drags himself away from the corpses of his fellow attackers. He runs right into a group of marines and is wounded and ends on the ground. One of the Malazans leaves a small clay ball on his lap and Corabb sees it smoking. He rolls away, grabs a helm, and slams it over the munition.</p><p>SCENE THIRTEEN</p><p>As they retreat, Cuttle tells Fiddler he left a sharper in Corabb’s lap and he’s “about to be surprised.” They watch Corabb cover it with a helm then get lifted by the explosion of fire under the helm like he’s riding a jetpack rocket. They continue to watch, stunned, as he lands hard on the ground, then runs off.</p><p>SCENE FOURTEEN</p><p>Gamet heads toward a besieged Malazan position but even as it’s overrun, he falls into a fog of confusion. Someone calls for him to get out of there, but he’s lost “Too many voices. Screams of the dying. The flames—they’re falling away. Darkness closing in. My soldiers are dying. Everywhere. It’s failed—the whole plan has failed.” He’s surrounded and about to be killed when a munition lands, killing the enemies and knocking him off his horse and even more senseless. Gesler arrive and he and Pella help him out, as he looks at Pella’s youth and thinks, “My mind is clear. Perfectly clear now. Finally. They’re all too young for this. It’s Laseen’s war—let her fight it. Tavore—she was a child once. But then the Empress murdered that child. Murdered her. I must tell the Adjunct.”</p><p>SCENE FIFTEEN</p><p>Cuttle joins Fiddler back at camp. They discuss Corabb’s miraculous survival of the sharper. Gesler joins them and tells them about the overrun position, saying it was screwed up—that most of the Malazans could have gotten away but only four out of three squads did. He says it could have been worse and leaves. Fiddler tells Cuttle to get his squad together so he can go over all the mistakes. Cuttle asks if one of them was Fiddler leading them up the barrow and Fiddler agrees it was, though Cuttle points out it probably saved lives. He tells Fiddler you can’t start second-guessing or using “what ifs.” Fiddler says he knows.</p><p>SCENE SIXTEEN</p><p>Tavore enters just as the healer finishes with Gamet. He assumes she’s there to relieve him of command. She tells him it was foolish to put himself at risk but hardly reason to remove him. He says it cost lives and she answers that every battle costs lives—”This is the burden of command. Did you this this war would be won without the spilling of blood?” He tells her he found out tonight he’s no longer a soldier, nor is he cut out to be a Fist. She nods and says since he’s wounded, she’ll allow a temporary field promotion and he suggests Keneb.</p><p>SCENE SEVENTEEN</p><p>Corabb joins Leoman in the aftermath of their heavy losses telling him Leoman had been right, “The Empress chose wisely.” When Leoman doesn’t answer, Corabb curses the marines and their munitions, saying they were the difference. He wishes he could have found one of those special crossbows. Leoman tells him to be quiet and orders him to send a messenger to Sha’ik saying Leoman will continue raiding and return three days ahead of Tavore’s army. The message is also that Leoman has no faith in Dom’s strategy or his tactics, though he knows Sha’ik will not listen.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty</strong></p><p>SCENE ONE</p><p>Cutter watches Apsalar move amidst the carnage left behind by Dancer at the Edur ships. He’s realized fighting swordsmen with knives isn’t the greatest idea, and so decides to learn the bow and use of long knives. He takes a bow from an Edur corpse and finds it harder than he had expected to string and draw. Apsalar tells him the sorcery on the ships is odd: “if this is Kurald Emurlahn, it is tainted in some way. Necromantically. Life and death magicks carved directly into the wood . . . As if warlocks and shoulder-women had done the consecrating.” She says the ship is like a temple and the blood spilled on it hasn’t desecrated it. She wonders if “even warrens can sink into barbarity” and then suggests the human warrens are “denigrations” of the Elder Warrens, saying “Even blood decays,” a phrase Cutter doesn’t understand the point of. As they prepare to leave, Cutter looks back and sees Traveler standing on a far strand with the surviving Malazan soldiers and the young Tiste Andii. As they push off, Apsalar says she thinks the group will commandeer the Edur dromon. When Cutters asks about protecting the Throne, she tells him there are shadow demons on the island now, seemingly sent by Dancer. Cutters asks why Dancer doesn’t just take the Throne into Shadow Realm, and she answers he would if he could, but Rake, when he sent his kind to protect it, also wove sorcery preventing it from being moved. Cutter says Shadowthrone only needs to “plant his scrawny arse on it,” then, and Apsalar replies “Thus ensuring that no one else could claim its power or the position of King of High House Shadow. Unless, of course, they killed Shadowthrone first. A god of courage and unassailable power might well plant his scrawny arse . . . But Shadowthrone did just that, once before, as Emperor Kellanved . . . He claimed the First Throne. The throne of the T’lan Imass . . . Fortunately, he has shown little interest in making use of his role as Emperor of the T’lan Imass.” Cutter says, “why bother? This way he negates the chance of anyone else finding and taking that throne, while his avoidance of using it himself ensures that no one takes notice he has it in the first place.” Apsalar admits she’d never thought of that and says it makes sense: “Unveiling power invites convergence, after all. It seems Shadowthrone has absorbed well his early residence in the Deadhouse. More so, perhaps, than Cotillion has.” Cutter agrees, calling it an “Azath tactic—negations serves to disarm,” then jokes that “Given the chance, [Shadowthrone would] probably plant himself on every throne in sight, then, with all the power accrued to him, he would do nothing with it.” But as he says it, first Apsalar then he realize what a coup that would be, “insane” an idea as it was: “All the games of the gods would be seriously curtailed. Crokus, have you stumbled onto the truth . . . Shadowthrone’s vast scheme. . His prodigious gambit to achieve absolute domination?” Cutter says Shadowthrone would have to be mad, that the whole thing is impossible to even consider. Apsalar tells him how Dancer and Shadowthrone disappeared for two years from the Empire, leaving it to Surly, adding though her vicarious memories are vague, she knows “both men were changed, irrevocably, by all that happened to them . . . Not just the play for Shadow Realm, which no doubt was central to their desires. Other things occurred, truths revealed, mysteries uncovered. One thing I know for certain, Cutter, is that for most of those two years, Dancer and Kellanved were not in this realm . . . I sense they were following a trail, one that wound through all the warrens and to realms where even the known warrens to not reach . . . the trail had something to do with the Houses of the Azath . . . They knew was Surly was planning for them. . . . Yet they returned nonetheless.” Cutter objects, saying that makes no sense, and she responds “Unless she proceeded to do precisely what they wanted her to do. After all, we both know the assassinations failed . . . the question then becomes what did that entire mess achieve?” Cutter answers “It left Surly on the Malazan throne . . . stripped from Kellanved his secular seat of power.. What if Kellanved and Dancer had returned and successfully reclaimed the imperial throne? But at the same time had taken over the Shadow Realm? Thus, there would be an empire spanning two warrens, an empire of Shadow . . . They [the gods] wouldn’t have stood for that . . . Ascendants of all kinds would have converged on the Malazan Empire . . .. Pounded the empire and the two men ruling it into dust.” Apsalar agrees, adding the two men hadn’t yet “consolidated their claim on the Shadow Realm” so wouldn’t have had the power to resist an attack. Cutter continues, “Right, so they orchestrated their own deaths and kept their identity as the new rulers of Shadow a secret for as long as they could . . . laying out the groundwork for a resumption of their grand schemes.” He says he’s lost as to what those plans are though. Apsalar picks up the discussion, saying “Cotillion recruited you to see to the true Throne of Shadow on Drift Avalii, the outcome of which could not have proved more advantageous to him and Shadowthrone. Darist dead, the sword Vengeance removed and in the hands of a darkly fated wanderer. The Edur expedition wiped out, the secret thus resurrected and likely to remain unviolated for some time,” though, she adds, Cotillion would probably have preferred not to intervene directly. Cutter informs her that he probably wouldn’t have had not the Hound Blind not balked at the Edur. She says that taught Dancer something else—he can’t count on the Hounds when they face the Edur—”their original masters.” They’re interrupted by a suddenly dark sky, “shadows rising on all sides, closing and swallowing them—a thunderous crash.”</p><p>SCENE TWO</p><p>Trull and Onrack encounter a large tortoise and banter about procreation and mating. They move on still tracking the renegades, from whom Onrack senses “a vague hint of chaos, of unknown warrens—or perhaps familiar ones twisted beyond recognition.” He goes through a list of Logros bonecasters trying to figure out which one is with the renegades, thinking it likely to be Logros because the renegades had come to Seven Cities, “to the very birthplace of the First Empire, in order to recover their weapons. And it was Logros who tasked with the holding of the homeland.” He asks Trull what he knows of the Nameless Ones and Trull says nothing. Onrack informs him that Logros had ordered the removal of the First Throne because the Nameless Ones were close to finding its location and knew that the T’lan Imass would have to “bow in service to the first mortal to seat himself on it.” Trull asks why Logros was so intent on denying the Nameless Ones and Onrack tells him “The Nameless Ones serve the Houses of the Azath. Logros believed that, had a priest of the cult taken the First Throne, the first and only command given to the T’lan Imass would be to voluntarily accept eternal imprisonment. We would have been removed from this world.” He adds the throne was moved to a continent south of Seven Cities where it was found by Kellanved. When Trull says that explains how the Malazan Empire got so powerful, Onrack tells him actually “The Emperor’s exploitation of our abilities was modest. Surprisingly constrained . . . The new Empress does not command us.” When Trull asks why Laseen doesn’t just sit on the throne, Onrack says she probably would if she knew where it was. Trull says the T’lan Imass are then free again, but Onrack replies, “There are other concerns. Kellanved was resident in a House of the Azath for a time,” which Trull takes as anxiety that Kellanved was a Nameless One or in contact with them. Trull asks why Kellanved wouldn’t have given the order that the Imass feared and also how Kellanved found the First Throne in the first place, but Onrack has no answer to either question. Trull wants to know what brought all this up and Onrack says he has a suspicion about where the renegades are heading, since some of them at least will know where the First Throne is. Trull says other T’lan Imass have probably figured that out, but Onrack says he shares a sense of freedom from the vow, a “certain liberation of thought” that makes him more likely than his kin to figure this out. He wants to wait for Monok Ochem and Ibra Gholan and tell them. Trull worries about this meeting, and points out Monok Ochem probably won’t like what Onrack did in repairing himself. Onrack agrees and Trull then asks what Onrack would do if he ordered him not to await his kin (based on Onrack’s earlier swearing of service to Trull). Onrack replies he understands Trull’s concern, but points out the renegades “serve the same master as do your kin. Should they lead one of your mortal kin to take the First Throne thus acquiring mastery over all of the T’lan Imass, do you imagine they will be as circumspect in suing those armies as was Emperor Kellanved? Trull surrenders the point, but wonders why the T’lan Imass don’t just sit on the throne themselves? Onrack says it must be a mortal, and what mortal could they trust? He does say, however, that the point will soon be moot, as a new, mortal bonecaster has arisen in a far-off land and has summoned the T’lan Imass. Trull asks if they want the new bonecaster to take the Throne and Onrack replies, “No. We want the summoner to free us all . . . from existence . . . Oddly enough, I find I do not share that sentiment anymore.” Trull guesses none who’ve escaped the vow would, and points out the bonecaster is therefore in some “grave danger.” Onrack says she is protected and when asked if he can resist her summons, says, “I am free to choose.” Monok and Ibra Gholan appear and Trull steps into Ibra’s path and tells him they should hear out Onrack before doing anything. Onrack tells them the renegades are leading their master to the First Throne to put a mortal on it and thus command the T’lan Imass, including the new bonecaster. He also offers to work with them to prevent that. Monok agrees immediately. Onrack asks how many guardians are set at the Throne and Monok says no, and there are no T’lan Imass at all on Quon Tali, saying this was “unanticipated” and all of Logros’ army is in Seven Cities. Onrack is shocked and asks why Logros hasn’t marched in answer to the summons. Monok says Logros sent representatives but is staying in Seven Cities “in anticipation of imminent need,” and the four of them are closest in any case to the renegades. Trull complains he needs a weapon and Ibra asks him what he uses. Trull answers spear and bow and Ibra says he’ll get one for him, but wonders why Trull didn’t take one from the caverns. Trull answers he isn’t a thief. Ibra then tells Onrack he chose well and Onrack thinks to himself, “I know,” before asking Monok if Logros knows who the renegade bonecaster is. Monok replies Tenag Illbaie, though he says probably under a different name. Onrack recalls Tenag’s pre-bonecaster name—Haran ‘Alle—and remembers his as loyal. Monok interrupts that Tenag failed against the Forkrul Assail in the L’aederon Wars and Onrack answers “as we in turn fail,” explaining when Monok asks how that they have failed because “We chose to see failure as disloyalty . . .Yet in our harsh judgment of fallen kin, we committed our own act of disloyalty. Tenag Illbaie strove to succeed in his task. His defeat was not by chance. Tell me, when have we ever triumphed in a clash with Forkrul Assail? Thus, Tenag Illbaie was doomed from the very beginning. Yet he accepted what was commanded of him. Knowing full well he would be destroyed and so condemned . . . these renegades are of our own making.” Ibra says “the it falls to us to deal with them,” but has no answer when Onrack asks what if they fail. As they prepare to move on via Tellann Warren, Monok asks Onrack where the rest of the body was that he used to repair himself. Onrack says it had been taken away, not does he know who destroyed it, though it made him “uneasy” because whoever did it had cut the body in half with a single blow.”</p><p>SCENE THREE</p><p>Lostara leads Pearl through the hills to where they killed Sha’ik Elder. Lostara thinks Pearl’s “smooth surface was wearing off, revealing unsightly patches that she found cause both for derision and a strange, insipid attraction . . . she had discovered a certain delicious appeal in flaws.” Pearl thinks how different things would have been had not Sha’ik’s bodyguards—Leoman and Karsa—kept the Red Blades from returning with Sha’ik’s head: “We’d likely not be here, for one thing. Felisin Paran would not have needed to cross all of Seven Cities seeking to avoid murder at the hands of frenzied rebels. Coltaine would be alive, closing the imperial fist around every smouldering ember before it rose in conflagration. And High Fist Pormqual would have been sent to the Empress to give an accounting of his incompetence and corruption. All but for that one obnoxious Toblakai.” They reach the spot and find the bodies of the Red Blades as well as Sha’ik’s corpse. Pearl wonders why the bodyguards waited there and Lostara suggest they waited for Sha’ik’s rebirth, mocking the idea. But Pearl points out the “rebirth did occur. The Whirlwind rose, to give focus—to provide a raging heart—for the rebellion.” Lostara though points to Sha’ik’s body and says clearly there was no rebirth. Pearl tells her she’s being purposely obtuse: “only one conclusion follows. The Sha’ik alive and well in the heart of Raraku is not the same Sha’ik. Those bodyguards found a replacement . . . younger in appearance . . . ” Lostara interrupts him and says she refuses to believe what he’s implying, arguing, “I don’t care how well it fits! Is that all we mortals are? The victims of tortured irony to amuse an insane murder of gods?” Pearl replies, “more like exquisite irony. You don’t think Felisin would leap at the chance to become such a direct instrument of vengeance against her sister? Against the empire that sent her to a prison mine? Fate may well present itself, but the opportunity must still be embraced, willfully, eagerly. There was less chance or coincidence in all this—more like the timely convergence of desires and necessities.” Lostara says they have to go back to Tavore, but Pearl says the Whirlwind is in their way, preventing travel by warren; they’ll have to penetrate it and cross through Raraku itself. Lostara asks about his hunt for the leader of the Talons and he says he thinks they’ll solve that problem soon too; “all things are converging nicely.” He faces the Whirlwind and says while Lostara’s Pardu blood means she won’t be noticed, his being quarter Tiste Andii might be an issue, telling her his mother was a “half-blood white-haired beauty” from Drift Avalii.</p><p>SCENE FOUR</p><p>Lostara and Pearl continue on, Lostara feeling “worn out and weathered” and jealous of Pearl’s “hale, unlined face.” She asks how he plans to avoid notice when they cross the Whirlwind and he tells her: “Rashan, Thyr, and Meanas. The perpetual war. This fragment of warren before us is not fully comprehended by the goddess herself. Not surprising, since she was likely little more than a zephyr spirit to being with.” After Lostara complains about his verbosity, he says, “fine, I intend to hide in your shadow.” As they continue to bicker, he points out to her that “you persist in fomenting a certain tension between us . . . a peculiar flirtation.” When she scoffs and responds with another attack, he says, “precisely as I was saying” which only infuriates her more.</p><p>SCENE FIVE</p><p>Lostara is surprised at how easy the crossing is. She turns to where Pearl is directly behind her, grabs him to kiss him, and the two begin disrobing.</p><p>SCENE SIX</p><p>Kalam wakes from a dream involving a song “rising to a roar that seemed to grip the throat of the world . . . And the voices within the song. Strange yet familiar. Like friends who never sang a word in their lives. Nothing to quell the spirit—no, these voices give music to war.” He heads out, passing petrified ships and relics of the past: “The Whirlwind had lifted the mantle of sands to reveal Raraku’s prehistory, the long-lost civilizations that had known only darkness of millennia. The scene was vaguely disturbing, as if whispering back to the nightmares that had plagued his sleep. And that damned song. The bones of sea-creatures crunched underfoot.” He stops when he sees a column of marching soldiers, some carrying wounded—an army of nearly six hundred carrying a standard made of a human ribcage with two skulls inside and antlers down the standard’s shaft. Watching, he realizes they are ghosts. He moves closer then hears someone say, ”He walks up from the sea . . .“ in an unknown yet understood language. Looking back he sees the depression he’d just walked across is now filled with water and has several damaged ships in it. He listens to a conversation:</p><p>”…Dessimbelackis throws endless legions at us and no matter how many we slaughter, the First Emperor finds more.“</p><p>”Not true, Lullsan. Five of the Seven Protectors are no more . . . And the sixth will not recover, now that we have banished the black beast itself.“</p><p>”I wonder, did we indeed drive it from this realm?“</p><p>”If the Nameless Ones speak true, then yes.“</p><p>”Your question, Kullsan, confuses me. Are we not marching from the city? Were we not just victorious?“</p><p>”Then why is our road lined with ghosts, Erethal?”</p><p>The conversation fades away and then as the last soldier passes, Kalam sees another ghost on the other side who tells him to listen to the soldiers, at which point Kalam realizes the ghost soldiers are singing a “variation” of his song. When Kalam addresses the ghost as a Tanno Spiritwalker, the ghost does not recognize the term, saying, “I am no priest. I am Tanno, the Eleventh and last Seneschal of Yaraghatan, banished by the First Emperor for my treasonous alliance with the Nameless Ones. Did you know what he would do? Would any of us have guessed? Seven Protectors indeed, but far more than that, oh yes, far more . . . I gave them a song, to mark their last battle. I gave them that at least.” When the ghost disappears, the land returns to normal. Kalam continues on, through the ruins of a city filed with old canals and bridges and potshards under his feet. He hears horses and, from a hiding spot, sees a group of Pardu, including a shaman. He watches what he assumes is the beginning of a ritual, and thinks these are not part of Sha’ik’s army. Suddenly two huge beasts arrive and attack the Pardu, quickly killing them then feeding on them: “As if darkness itself had taken form, only the shimmer of their sleek hides betrayed their presence . . . These were not Hounds of Shadow. If anything, they were larger, bulkier, massing more like a bear than a dog . . . the moved with savage grace, primal and deadly. Devoid of fear and supremely confident, as if this strange place they had come to was as familiar to them as their own hunting grounds.” One suddenly seems to sense Kalam’s hiding spot and comes at him fast, giving Kalam barely time to jump away and fling down his last few “smoky diamonds—his own cache, not Iskaral Pust’s.” Kalam blows the whistle and five demons rise and while three attack the Hound, the other two flank Kalam, moving toward the other Hound. Kalam runs while the sound of battle rages behind him. As he listens, he thinks, “My apologies Shadowthrone, but at least one of your demons should survive long enough to escape. In which case, you will be informed of a new menace unleashed on this world. And consider this—if there’s two of them, there’s probably more.” Meanwhile, the blowing of the whistle had released all the diamond demons: “countless smoky diamonds that had originated from a trader in G’danisban’s market round crumbled into dust—whether placed for safe-keeping in locked chests, worn as rings . . . And from the dust rose azalan demons, awakened long before their intended moment. But that suited them just fine. They had, one and all, appointed tasks that demanded a certain solitude . . . making it necessary to quickly silence every witness, which the azalan were pleased to do . . . For those that had appeared in the ruins of a city in Raraku, however, to find two creatures whose existence was very nearly lost to the demon’s racial memory, the moments immediately following their arrival proved somewhat more problematic . . . the five azalan were eventually driven off, battered and bleeding . . . And in the realm known as Shadow, a certain god sat motionless on his insubstantial throne. Already recovered from his shock, his mind was racing. Racing.”</p><p>SCENE SEVEN</p><p>Cutter and Apsalar suddenly crash into a chamber filled with bhok’arala and find Pust waiting for them (it’s his temple). Pust refers to “the extremity of what will be demanded of us in the days and nights to come.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-One</strong></p><p>SCENE ONE</p><p>Febryl heads toward a meeting with Reloe. He thinks how the world is “plunging into chaos” but also how “the past was not dead. It merely slept. The perfect, measured resurrection of old patterns could achieve a rebirth.” He recalls his service to the Holy Falah’d Enqura in the Holy City of Ugarat during a time of renaissance when its eleven great schools were rediscovering lost knowledge and beginning to open up a new world. But the Malazan invasion had destroyed all that, though it had been Febryl himself—under order of the Falah’d—who had destroyed the knowledge: burning all the texts and crucifying the scholars (those they didn’t kill themselves) so that the Malazans got nothing. Febryl considers that act his “last gesture of loyalty, of pure unsullied courage.” Afterward, his parent had disowned him and he killed them and their servants with sorcery, magic that left him “old beyond his years, wrinkled and withered, his bones brittle and bent.” His appearance so changed, he was able to evade the search set for him by the Holy Falah’d. He thinks “unforgivable” though he is unsure to which act he applies the word: the destruction of all that knowledge (even other Falad’han, along with the Malazans, had considered it “the foulest deed of all), the murder of his parents, the evasion of the Holy Falah’d? The problem was Sha’ik knew all of it, and “no possessor of his secrets would be permitted to live. He refused to be so vulnerable . . . And so she must be removed.” Thus his plotting with the Malazans, though he knows Dom’s plans go far beyond the Whirlwind toward imperial power. He knows as well that Mallick Rel, now heading toward Aren to surrender himself and be brought before the Empress, is part of that plotting. He imagines Rel will “announce an extraordinary reversal of fortunes in Seven Cities. Korbolo Dom had been working in her interests all along . . . Pormqual would be made the singular focus for the debacle of Coltaine’s death and the slaying of the High Fist’s army. The Jhistal would slip through . . . Dom had agents in the palace in Unta.” But Febryl believes he will outwit them as each of the conspirators lie to each other. He meets Reloe and four of Dom’s assassins. Reloe is anxious for Febryl to immediately open a path for them, but Febryl says Reloe needs to know more about it, explaining: “The goddess was a spirit once . . . But what kind of spirit? One that rides the desert winds, you might think. But you are wrong . . . Raraku holds the bones of countless civilizations, leading back to the First Empire, the empire of Dessimbelackis. And still further . . . The First Empire of Dessimbelackis was not the first. That belonged to the T’lan Imass. There was little, it is true, that you or I might recognize as being ‘Imperial.’ No cities. No breaking of the ground . . . There was a throne of course, upon which was meant to sit a mortal—the progeny race of the T’lan Imass . . . Alas, humans viewed empire differently. And their vision did not include T’lan Imass. Thus, betrayal. Then war. An unequal contest, but the T’lan Imass were reluctant to annihilate their mortal children. And so they left.” Reloe picks up the history, noting the T’lan Imass returned with the Soletaken/D’ivers ritual, then asks if the goddess of the Whirlwind is T’lan Imass, though he points out her rage is unlike them. Febryl says that’s true, “unless she had reason. Memories of a betrayal, perhaps from her mortal life. A wound too deep to be eradicated by the Ritual of Tellann.” Reloe inquires if the Ritual still binds her and Febryl answers no, “She broke those chains long ago and has reclaimed her soul—Raraku’s secret gifts are those of life and death . . . It returned to her all that she had lost—perhaps even the rebirth of her rage. Raraku remains the deepest mystery of all, for it holds its own memories, of the sea, of life’s very own waters. And memories are power.” Reloe tells him to open the path and as he begins to do so, Febryl thinks how the Malazans will owe him and so Seven Cities will be freed of Malazan troops and influence and “our civilization shall flower once more.”</p><p>SCENE TWO</p><p>L’oric senses the approach of something “bestial and wild with power . . . Ancient wars, such is the feel of this, as of enmity reborn, a hatred that defies millennia.” He feels that none in the oasis are the target, but they are in the way of it. In his tent, he finds “The Whirlwind’s rage had never before been so fierce . .. . The final clash of wills was fast approaching. This was, in truth, a convergence, and the currents had trapped other powers, pulling them along with relentless force. And behind it all, the whispers of a song.” He thinks he should run, take Felisin and maybe Heboric and do so quickly, but his curiosity holds him—”truths [would be] revealed and he would know them. I came to Raraku because I sense my father’s presence, somewhere close.” He wonders what the Queen of Dreams meant when she’d said Osric was “lost,” and thinks how “Kurald Thyrllan had been born of violence, the shattering of Darkness. The Elder Warren had since branched off in many directions, reaching to within the grasp of mortal humans as Thyr. And before that, in the guise of life-giving fire, Tellann . . . a powerful presence here in Seven Cities, obscure and buried deep perhaps, but pervasive . . . Whereas Kurald Thyrllan has been twisted and left fraught by the shattering of its sister warren. There were no easy passages into Thyrllan.” He decides, then, to try Tellann. He dons Liosan armor and sword, though “He despised fighting. Unlike his Liosan kin, he was averse to harsh judgment, to the assertion of a brutally delineated world-view that permitted no ambiguity. He did not believe order could be shaped by a sword’s edge. Finality, yes, but finality stained with failure.”</p><p>SCENE THREE</p><p>L’oric reaches Karsa’s grove and find Felisin asleep. He faces the seven faces of the Teblor “gods” and realizes their spirits were gone and the grove was not sacred to something else. The “gods” had left behind a trail though, that he thinks he can use to enter the Tellann Warren. He enters and finds himself beside a huge lake, realizing quickly “I am in the wrong place, or the wrong time. This is Raraku’s most ancient memory.” He startles a hyena the size of a bear then heads off down the path it left as it ran away. He comes across the humanoid corpse the hyena had been feeding on: “As tall as a normal man [with] a pelt of find dark hair . . . Sloped forehead, solid chinless jaw, a brow ridge so heavy it formed a contiguous shelf over the deep-set eye sockets . . . More ape-like than a T’lan Imass. The skull behind the face is smaller as well. Yet it stood taller by far, more human in proportion. What manner of man was this?” He moves on, though he has no place in mind to get to. He believes he has found not Tellann but “what lay beneath Tellann . . . Toblakai’s glade was not a place freshly sanctified by the giant warrior . . . It had, at the very beginning, belonged to Raraku, to whatever natural power the land possessed.” He sees a herd of huge cattle-like creatures suddenly panic and stampede, then hides as he sees what caused the panic: “Seven hounds, black as midnight, of a size to challenge the wild antlered cattle . . . And flanking them, like jackals flanking a pride of lions, a score or more of the half-human creatures such as the one he had discovered at the lakeshore. They were clearly subservient, in the role of scavengers to predators. No doubt there was some mutual benefit to the partnership, though L’oric could imagine no real threat in this world to those dark hounds. And there was no doubt in his mind, those hounds did not belong here. Intruders. Strangers to this realm, against which nothing in this world can challenge. They are the dominators, and they know it.” He then notices three K’Chain Che’Malle tracking the hounds and thinks “Not of this realm either, if my father’s thoughts on the matter are accurate. He was Rake’s guest for months in Moon’s Spawn, delving its mysteries. But the K’Chain Che’Malle cities lie on distant continents. Perhaps they only recently arrived here, seeking new sites for their colonies, only to find their dominance challenged. The hounds and semi-humans appear not to notice the K’Chain, who follow them after they disappear into a basin. Suddenly the K’ell Hunters are attacked, two of them falling quickly to the hounds while the third runs away, unpursued. L’oric heads away, but then sees the hounds and humans look in his direction, then follow him. A dragon swoops down, grabs him in its talons and lifts him into the sky, carrying him far out to sea to an island tower where it deposits him. L’oric faces the dragon and tells it “Father, I’ve been looking for you.”</p><p>SCENE FOUR</p><p>L’oric tells his father, back in Liosan form, how the Queen of Dreams had thought him lost and Osric replies, “I am. Or rather, I was. Further, I would remain so.” When L’oric asks if Osric trusts her, his father answers yes, but his trust is “purer by her ignorance.” Osric asks what L’oric is doing there and L’oric says he doesn’t even know where he is, and that he was looking for “truths.” Osric calls his tower an observation point to spot the K’Chain Che’Malle skykeeps as they near the area. L’oric makes the connection to Osric’s studies of Moon’s Spawn and asks what he’d learned that Rake had overlooked. Osric says lots, noting that Moon’s Spawn had shown evidence of being attacked and breached and mentions how he and Rake had discovered it in a glacier that had carried it a thousand leagues from the crash site. L’oric asks if Osric is saying Moon’s Spawn was one of the skykeeps where they are and Osric answers yes, adding three have appeared during his stay there and all were destroyed by the Deragoth—”The Hounds of Darkness. The seven beasts that Dessimbelackis made pact with—and oh, weren’t the Nameless Ones shaken by that unholy alliance? The seven beasts, L’oric, that gave the name to Seven cities . . . The Seven Holy Cities of our time are not the original ones, of course. Only the number has survived.” L’oric asks what happened to the Deragoth, “Why are they here and not there?” Osric replies he doesn’t know, though he wonders if it had to do with the collapse of the First Empire. Questioned as to which warren they’re now in, Osric tells L’oric it isn’t a warren at all, but “a memory. Soon to end, I believe, since it is shrinking . . . Raraku’s [memory].” L’oric changes the subject to the semi-humans. Osric calls them “the Deragoth’s only act of domestication” and when L’oric declares they aren’t human or even T’lan Imass, Osric says “they will be, one day” describing how he’s also seen them in partnership with wolf packs, their taller vision supplementing the wolves’ hearing and smell. While the wolves are in charge, Osric believes that will eventually change, though the relationship between the Deragoth and semi-humans will not, “because something is about to happen. Here in this trapped memory. I only hope that I will be privileged to witness it.” L’oric wonders if the Deragoth are the children of Mother Dark and Osric say no, “they have that stench about them, but in truth I have no idea. It just seemed an appropriate name.” When L’oric corrects his translation of Tiste Andii, Osric says he’s just like his mother, whom he couldn’t stand the company of past three days (the feeling was mutual). When L’oric wants to know how long his father could stand his only son’s company, Osric answers “three bells” rather than three days. L’oric tells him before he leaves that Osric probably should know that the Liosan and Thyrllan warren have lost their protector and “pray for your return.” Osric tells him to just get another familiar, but L’oric says it isn’t that easy then gets angry, asking if Osric has no sense of responsibility to the Liosan who worship him. But Osric argues they worship themselves and he just happens to be “a convenient figurehead,” adding that Kurald Thyrllan really isn’t vulnerable despite appearances. L’oric, though, wonders if he can be so sure if the Deragoth do turn out to be servants of Darkness. Osric is silenced then heads out as L’oric follows. Osric takes his dragon form, “Like Anomander Rake, Osric was more dragon than anything else. They were kin in blood, if not in personality.” L’oric wishes he knew his father better, as well as wishing he liked him. When Osric reaches out a talon, L’oric says he’d rather ride his back, but Osric just ignores him.</p><p>SCENE FIVE</p><p>Osric flies toward mountains, landing at the edge of the memory. “There were things near the faded edge of the memory” and Osric explained that various creatures—”demons mostly” appear near the “verge.” They stop before one such, “dog-sized and reptilian, with four hands similar to an apes. A wide, flat head with a broad mouth, two slits for nostrils, and four liquid, slightly protruding eyes in a diamond pattern.” L’oric mentally communicates with it and it understands both him and the bargain L’oric offers: “A partnership, a binding of spirits. Power from you, power from me. In exchange for my life. Uneven bargain. Position devoid of clout.” L’oric says he’ll save it anyway and the demon says save him and then they can talk of an alliance. L’oric says fine and when Osric worries that without a binding L’oric might be betrayed, L’oric says he’ll risk it. The demon is excited that L’oric has a father that is an eleint (dragon). It gives his name as Greyfrog.</p><p>SCENE SIX</p><p>L’oric and Greyfrog return to Raraku via portal, with L’oric wishing he’d asked more questions of Osric and thinking his long-anticipated meeting with him had seemed mere “distraction” to his father: “Osric’s interest was with Osric. His own pursuits.” Greyfrog says he smells raw meat and is hungry and as they head off to find food, L’oric explains there are rules about what Greyfrog can kill and not kill.</p><p>SCENE SEVEN</p><p>Sha’ik looks to the coming battle: “Vengeance had been her lifeblood for so long, now, within days, she would come face to face with her sister.” She believes she holds all the cards: a more experienced and larger army, familiar territory, Elder magic, better and more mages. But despite all that she remains “terrified . . . She wanted to run. The game was too hard, too fraught. Its final promise was cold—colder than she had ever imagined. Vengeance is a wasted emotion, yet I have let it consume me. I gave it like a gift to the goddess. Fragments of clarity—they were diminishing . . . as the hold of the Whirlwind Goddess tightened on her soul. My sister traded me for the faith of the Empress . . . all to serve her ambition . . . And I in turn have traded my freedom for the power of the Whirlwind Goddess so that I can deliver just vengeance against my sister. Are we, then, so different?” She realizes the goddess is keeping her from thinking overmuch. Bidithal arrives and the two banter about shadows. Bidithal says he was never a Meanas priest and Sha’ik responds, “No, here it was Rashan, ghost-child of Kurald Galain, yet the warren it claimed was, nonetheless, Shadow. We are both well aware that the distinctions diminish the closer one delves into the mysteries of the most ancient triumvirate.” She asks he sends shadows to spy on her and he replies that perhaps they are protectors. She wonders from what and he says he is near to learning “the precise nature of the threat,” though now he is more concerned with L’oric and Heboric, telling her “We are at the heart of a convergence and not just between us and the Malazans.” He notes that Heboric is a priest yet again, and when she starts to argue that Fener is gone, he interrupts to say it is Treach, not Fener, to whom Heboric is now connected. Sha’ik refuses to believe either Heboric would accept another god or that a god would choose Heboric, but he informs her that despite that, Treach has chosen Heboric as Destriant. She is silenced at first, then says where else would a god of war be then here, though she says she will think on the matter. Bidithal tries to convince her that a newly-powered Heboric can be a threat due to his “ambivalence to our cause,” but she doesn’t buy it. As for L’oric, Bidithal is suspicious over how L’oric has become “more elusive” and more “extreme” in his attempts to hide his comings and goings. Sha’ik says she has no concern over him and orders Bidithal to call off his shadows and focus on Febryl, Dom, and Reloe. He says fine and after a moment’s close look, she tells him to “be careful,” at which he “pales slightly” then nods and responds, “I am ever that.” She dismisses him and he leaves, thinking to himself he will not call off his shadows at all and looking forward to when “this fragment of shattered warren would become a realm unto itself. And the Whirlwind Goddess would see the need for a priesthood, a structure of power in the mortal world . . . and there would be no place for Sha’ik.” He turns his mind to the conspirators, suspecting that “Febryl’s alliance with the Napan and Kamist Reloe was but temporary . . . [holding] a hidden, final betrayal, one concluding in the mutual annihilation of every interest but his own. And I cannot pierce to the truth . . . I must side for Sha’ik, for it will be her hand that crushes the conspirators.” His thoughts are interrupted by the appearance of Febryl himself, who declares the moment is now for Bidithal to declare whether he will join the conspirators or stand aside. Bidithal asks if there is a third choice and Febryl says not if he means fighting against them. He informs Bidithal that his reward whether he joins or just steps aside—will be a High Priest of the cult of the Apocalypse, “ensconced in a vast, rich temple . . . How would you shape such a cult? . . . you have already begun, Bidithal. We know all about your special children. Imagine . . . all of Seven Cities, honored to deliver you their unwanted daughters.” Bidithal tries to argue for more time, but Febryl says it’s too late, they’ve already begun, agents are in place, tasks have been given. Bidithal says he accepts so long as the cult is his alone to shape and Febryl says he guarantees it. When Bidithal asks about Dom and Reloe, Febryl replies “What worth their vows? The Empress had Korbolo Dom’s once. Sha’ik did as well,” to which Bidithal thinks, “As she had yours too, Febryl.” Febryl leaves and Bidithal realizes he truly had no third option, that Febryl had been dismissive of Bidithal’s shadows and would have killed him if he’d said no. He wonders what had made Febryl so confident. He heads back to his temple, thinking “You do not dismiss what you know nothing of . . . He felt vulnerable.”</p><p>SCENE EIGHT</p><p>Scillara tries to think through a haze of durhang over what had just happened a few moments ago—Febryl telling Dom something about her master Bidithal. She barely recalls a time when her mind was clear, though she suspects those were relatively unpleasant times anyway and so no great loss. But she wishes she were more lucid so as to better serve Bidithal, and hopes perhaps by doing so she’ll be able to help with his “freeing” of the new girls. She sits up and, feeling the heaviness of her breasts, wonders if she is pregnant. She heads out of the tent but one of the guards this time follow her, telling her “Febryl has wearied of your spying. He wants Bidithal blind and deaf in this camp. It grieves me, Scillara. It does. Truly . . . It’s a mercy I think, and I will make it as painless as possible. For I liked you once.” As he speaks of having sex with her first, she tries to understand that he’s talking of killing her. As he rapes her, she grabs the knife he’d laid aside and stabs him, killing him as he orgasms. She rolls him off and sits up, thinking “I am a vessel ever filled, yet there’s always room for more. More durhang. More men and their seeds. My master found my place of pleasure and removed it. Ever filled, yet never filled up. There is no base to this vessel. This is what he has done. To all of us.” The other guard appears, punches her to near-unconsciousness, then drags her off to kill her and dispose of the body. He stops suddenly and a figure emerges and kills him, a figure with a strangely glowing (green) hand, “a hand taloned like a huge cat’s.” Her savior, Heboric, tells her he’s been looking for her, “or so I’ve just realized. Extraordinary, how single lives just fold into the whole mess, over and over again, all caught up in the greater swirl. Spinning round and round, and ever downward it seems. Ever downward. Fools, all of us, to think we can swim clear of that current.” He places his hand on her and heals her: “a tremble ran through her. That spread, coursing hot through her veins. .. along her throat, in her lungs, between her legs. The man grunted. ‘I thought it was just consumption . . . too much durhang. As for the rest, well, it’s an odd thing about pleasure. Something Bidithal would have you never know. Its enemy is not pain. No, pain is simply the path taken to indifference. And indifference destroys the soul. Of course, Bidithal likes destroyed souls—to mirror his own.’ . . . Sensations long lost flooded into her.” He tells her he’ll take her to his temple where she’ll be safe, adding he thinks he’ll need her help, though “the choice is yours. Nor will you have to surrender anything you don’t want to. And if you choose to simply walk away, that is fine as well. I will give you money and a supplies and maybe even find you a horse.” He introduces himself as Heboric, Destriant to Treach, the Tiger of Summer and the God of War. She says she’s sorry, but she’s “had my fill of priests,” but he says so has he.</p><p>SCENE NINE</p><p>Felisin and L’oric watch Greyfrog eat and L’oric introduces him as his new familiar. He tells her she needs to leave as soon as possible and he will follow as soon as he can. He adds he will send Greyfrog with her and, he hopes, one other. She says she’s ready to leave, that she no longer dreams of vengeance against Bidithal. When she asks if that is cowardly of her, he tells her Bidithal will be taken care of “in a manner befitting his crimes,” though he says it will not be by his hands: “There will be a convergence Felisin. With some unexpected guests. And I do not think anyone here will survive their company for long. There will be vast slaughter.” He will stay, however, for he still seeks answers. He leaves her with Greyfrog.</p><p>SCENE TEN</p><p>Heboric and L’oric meet, with Heboric making no attempt at hiding his nature as Treach’s Destriant, knowing it would be futile. They agree battle is soon and L’oric wants Heboric to take Felisin away tonight. Heboric agrees, though he says it won’t be tonight and that there will be a third—”a certain poetry to there being three of us.” Both agree that they will leave Bidithal to his fate.</p><p>SCENE ELEVEN</p><p>Leoman and Corabb watch the Malazans. The two of them are exhausted from the non-stop harassment they’ve given to Tavore’s army, sufficient to bleed them but not turn them, though Corabb thinks given enough soldiers they could have.   They’re down to only 700 rebels left, and now the Malazans will be at the Whirlwind by dusk.  Leoman says they will pass through, there will be battle and “Korbolo Dom will command . . . you and I and likely Mathok shall  . . . watch . . . Our war is done.”  The two head into the Whirlwind.</p><p>SCENE TWELVE</p><p>Karsa has been riding back for some time and he nears Raraku, sensing the battle is nigh. He wants to be there, “not to kill Malazans but to guard Leoman’s back . . . there are those in camp who deserve only death. And I shall deliver it . . . I have tolerated the deceitful and the malicious for long enough. My sword shall now answer them.”  He speaks o Siballe who tells him he is with her in the House of Chains, he is the Knight of Chains and the Crippled God will “not expect you to kneel [will] issue no commands to his Mortal Sword, his Knight of Chains—for that is what you are, the role for which you have been shaped from the very beginning.”  Karsa refuses the role or another “false god” and says the Crippled God has much to answer for. She tells him the other gods chained him to dead ground and he has been twisted by his long torment. Karsa says he will break the god’s chains, and then he will kill him.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Two</strong></p><p>SCENE ONE</p><p>Fiddler is hanging around the campfire, his marines augmented by several squads of medium infantry, including the Ninth squad (sergeant Balm, also has Deadsmell and Throatslitter. Other squads include Moak, Able, Shortnose, and others). Balm joins Fiddler and says he’s heard “Strings” isn’t his real name. After some banter about names, he asks what Fiddler thinks of moving squads around this late in the game as well as what he thinks of Keneb. Balm himself isn’t sure about Keneb, though he’s pretty sure Ranal, based on being a noble, is likely to get them killed. Gesler joins them, along with two other sergeants: Moak and Thom Tissy. Moak asks if anyone’s heard of “that killer soldier. Heavy infantry, not sure what company. . Neffarias Bredd. I head he killed eighteen raiders all in one night.” There’s some dispute over just how many Bredd killed, so Fiddler calls over another heavy—Flashwit—and she says she’d heard fifty, though she doesn’t know what legion he’s in. The heavy sergeants join and want to know about tomorrow, when Tavore faces the Whirlwind wall “with that sword. Then what? She stabs it? . . . And aren’t we already in Raraku? . . . Why don’t we just wait for them? Or let ’em stay and rot here . . .Sha’ik wants an empire of sand, let her have it.” Fiddler explains if they leave Sha’ik it will be like a rot that will spread. As for Raraku, he says “If it possesses a power, then that lies in what it does to you, after a while. Maybe not in what it does, but what it gives. Not an easy thing to explain.” Moak repeats some rumors—that they’ll go east and north to wait for Dujek and Tayschrenn. Or that Greymane will be recalled from the Korelri campaign. Fiddler heads off and comes across his squad around Bottle, who is trying a divination using twigs and sticks, something he says he learned from his grandmother, explaining both she and his mother were witches. When asked about his father, he just leaves it at “there were rumors . . . ” Fiddler surprises everyone at his knowledge about this sort of magic. Bottle pulls out a grass doll and says he was trying to have it be “the hand of death . . . but it’s not cooperating. Fiddler asks if he’s using Hood’s warren and Bottle replies “a little,” which makes Fiddler think “There’s more to this lad than I’d first thought.” Fiddler tells him to forget Hood—”He may hover, but won’t stride forward until after the fact”—and try the Patron of Assassins. Bottle flinches at the idea, and Smiles says she’s starting to think he’s just pretending to knowledge, because he’s saying he knows Shadow, Meanas, Hood, and witchery. Bottle performs the spell (with some help from Fiddler) and says he can feel the Rope “close, way too close. There’s power, pouring into or maybe out of that doll, only it’s not moving.” Fiddler points out the doll isn’t moving, but its shadow is. Bottle ends and asks why only the shadow moved and Fiddler says, “Because he isn’t ready yet.” Smiles wants to know if it was the Rope himself, and Bottle says he’s positive it isn’t. Fiddler walks away thinking “No, not the Rope. Someone even better, as far as I’m concerned. As far as every Malazan is concerned . . . He’s here. And he’s on the other side of the Whirlwind Wall. And I know precisely who he’s sharpened his knives for. Now if only that damned singing would stop.”</p><p>SCENE TWO</p><p>Gamet stands, feeling that “spirits screamed at him, ghostly hands reaching out through Hood’s Gate. He wants to die to atone for his incompetency that led to the needless deaths of his men: It had driven him mad . . . The voices, the paralyzing uncertainty, the way we was always cold, shivering . . . and the weakness, stealing through his limbs, thinning the blood . . . ‘I have been broken. I failed the Adjunct.'” He thinks Keneb was a good choice as Fist and will do well, especially as he has a family to fight for, to return to. He bemoans his uselessness: “She has certainly never needed me . . . The family tore itself apart and there was nothing I could do . . . Even when a word from me could have changed Felisin’s fate, I just saluted and said ‘Yes, Mistress.'” He believes all his failures and flaws, Tavore has merely seen as acts of loyalty, “the disciplined acceptance of orders no matter how horrendous their outcome. His thoughts are interrupted by Grub (Keneb’s adopted boy) telling him “Loud.” At first Gamet thinks he’s referring to the voices in his head, but Grub then says it’s the sandstorm. Gamet awakens to his surroundings and sees he stands near the Whirlwind Wall, its roar sounding like the voices in his head. He tells himself “I’m not mad.” Grub answers “Me neither,” before saying he likes the new armlet Keneb gets to wear (as Fist): “It’s very shiny. Do you like shiny things? I do, even though they hurt my eyes. Maybe it’s because they hurt my eyes. Grub then tells Gamet that both he and his father feel Gamet thinks too much “about things there’s no point in thinking about,” though he adds he knows why Gamet does this: “The same reason I like shiny things.” Grub leaves to tell Keneb, who has been looking for Gamet, that he found him. Staring at the Whirlwind, Gamet senses it has something new in it, some sense of urgency. He wonders what he was doing there, and then recalls, “He had come looking for death. A raider’s blade across his throat . . . an end to thinking all those thoughts that so hurt my eyes.”</p><p>SCENE THREE</p><p>Keneb and Temul arrive and Keneb says they’ve been looking all over for Gamet. When Gamet says Grub had found him and headed off to let Keneb know, Keneb says he doubts it: “He’s yet to say a word to me. Not even in Aren. I’ve heard he talks to others. . But not me. And no, I don’t know why.” He informs Gamet that Tavore is ready to use her otataral sword to breach the Whirlwind and she’s waiting for Gamet. Gamet says she needn’t and when Keneb agrees but says she is anyway and commands his presence, Gamet reluctantly joins them. They ride to where Tavore waits, along with Tene Baralta, Blistig, Nil, and Nether. Gamet warns her there could be an entire army on the other side, but Tavore tells him not to worry: “Besides, can you not hear it? Its shriek is filled with fear. A new sound.” Gamet listens and realizes that is what he had sensed earlier. He asks what will happen when the Whirlwind falls and Nil answers “The Whirlwind Wall encloses a warren. Destroy the Wall and the warren is breached. Making the goddess vulnerable . . . The Army of the Apocalypse will remain strengthened by her power. Those soldiers will never break, will fight on to the bitter end. Especially given the likelihood that that end will be ours, not theirs.” Tavore tells Nil his pessimism isn’t appreciated, then moves with the group to near the wall. Before she can fully unsheathed her sword, the Wall withdraws, leaving the way clear. Tavore asks Nil why and he speculates “She would not willingly take such a wounding . . . She will rely upon her mortal army.” They see Raraku before them and remount, Tavore ordering Temul to send out scouts, though she assumed “they wait for us at a place of their own choosing.” Gamet thinks “and then will come the battle. The death of hundreds, perhaps thousands of soldiers. The Adjunct, as the fist of the Empress. And Sha’ik, Chosen servant of the goddess. A clash of wills, nothing more. Yet it will decide the fate of hundreds of thousands. I want nothing to do with this.” Baralta pulls up next to him and says they need Gamet more than ever, that Tavore needs a “cautious voice.” Gamet rejects the idea and when Baralta brings up the “fog that comes in battle,” Gamet says he’s well aware of it: “I was a soldier once. And I did well enough at that . . . commanding no one but myself . . . I was at my level of competence all those years ago. Baralta replies he should then become simply a solder again, give Tavore that perspective, “realized that whatever weakness you feel is not unique—it is shared, by hundreds or even thousands, there in our legions.” Blistig joins them, adding “She remains too remote from us Gamet. She is without our advice because we have no chance to give it. Worse, we don’t know her strategy . . . Nor her tactics for this upcoming battle . . . It’s dangerous, against Malazan military doctrine. She’s made this war personal.” Gamet looks at Tavore studying the wasteland ahead and thinks “Personal? Yes, she would do that. Because it is what she has always done.” Out loud, he tells them “It is how she is.” Baralta worries they are moving into a trap designed by Dom, but Gamet says Tavore is aware of that possibility but what else can she do but march to meet the enemy? Blistig says they should discuss it, maybe find another path, but Gamet mocks that idea, saying Dom would have foreseen that and destroyed all the waterholes so Raraku could do the killing for him. He says they should just wait, that Tavore will surely call a war council when one is needed. Baralta says she’d better and rides off. Blistig says when she does, Gamet needs to be there, saying “We have enough baggage on this train, with all those nobleborn officers and their endless lists of grievances. Soldiers up from the ranks are rare enough in this army—too rare to see even one throw himself away. I didn’t think much of you at first. You were the Adjunct’s pet. But you managed your legion well enough.” He explains how Gamet erred in putting himself in battle itself, something a Fist should never do—they need to stay back, be “the core . . . If the core wavers or vanishes, the legion falls.” He presses Gamet to take back his command from Keneb, who was only named acting Fist after all, especially as Keneb was a good captain but now there’s a “damned fool” noble in his captain’s place. He continues to push, finally telling Gamet “cease your selfish sulking old man and step back in line.” Gamet backhands Blistig off his horse and breaking his nose, then rides to Tavore and tells him he’s ready to return to duty. Tavore accepts that, but advises him to have those sort of “disagreements” with his fellow Fists in “more private locations in the future.” Gamet looks back at Blistig, who has gotten to his feet smiling. He thinks, “I owe him a free shot,” and leaves Tavore to go “speak” to him.</p><p>SCENE FOUR</p><p>Fiddler and sergeants climb a hill for a better view of the collapsing Whirlwind wall. Fiddler says “The goddess withdrew . . . I would bet the Adjunct didn’t even draw her sword.” When Borduke wonders why the wall was raised in the first place, Fiddler says he has no idea, “There are other things going on here in Raraku, things we know nothing about.” Gesler guesses it was to keep the Claw out, adding, “Sha’ik and her goddess want this battle. They want it clean. Soldier against soldier. Mage against mage, commander against commander.” But Fiddler says that’s too bad because he has “a hunch . . . they’ve been infiltrated. That’s what I saw from Bottle’s divination. Wish I could be there to see it . . . to help.” Tugg says Moak has heard the Adjunct has something unexpected planned that means they won’t fight at all. Fiddler wants to know where Moak gets all this information and Tugg says he doesn’t know but he “knows things . . . He’s been right plenty of times . . . He says you [Fiddler] were in Onearm’s Host and the Empress wants your head on a spike because you’ve been outlawed . . And he says you [Gesler] and your corporal Stormy are Old Guard . . . serving Dassem Ultor, or maybe Cartheron Crust or his brother Urko . . . And you Borduke, you once threw a nobleborn officer off a cliff.” The others stare at him, then Gesler “drily” says “amazing how wrong he got it all.” When Fiddler worries Moak’s been spreading these stories, Tuggs says Moak only told him and Sobelone and told them not to tell anyone else. Horns sound the march.</p><p>SCENE FIVE</p><p>Keneb rides up next to Gamet in the rear guard. When Gamet starts to apologize for reclaiming his title, Keneb says he needn’t as he’s happier where he is and because Ranal’s promotion to captain was revoked, especially as Ranal had rearranged the units, “using Greymane’s arrangements. Of course, Greymane was fighting a protracted war over a huge territory with no defined front. He needed self-contained fighting units, ready for any contingency. Even more irritating, he [Ranal] neglected to inform anyone.” He says he’s waiting for Gamet before putting things back, but Gamet says he’ll inform Tavore they’re going to leave it, saying, “it might prove useful. We are to hold the rear at the battle on a broken landscape. Ranal’s decision, no doubt made in ignorance, is none the less suitable.” When Keneb sighs at the news, Gamet knows why, thinking “I may have returned as Fist with the Adjunct’s confirmation, but her decision on our positioning has made it clear she’s lost confidence in me.” They ride on in uncomfortable silence.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Three</strong></p><p>SCENE ONE</p><p>Mogora “cooks” for Apsalar and Cutter while complaining about Pust’s absence, the lack of real food around, etc. Before leaving, she mentions Kalam was there earlier, which surprised Cutter but not Apsalar (Kalam had left Bridgeburner marks). Apsalar says “Shadowthrone and Cotillion have it seems found use for us all. If I were to guess, Kalam plans on killing as many of Sha’ik’s officers as he can.” Cutter wonders what they’re doing there and Apsalar says she doesn’t know, but believes Cotillion is interested more in Cutter than her because she is “not interested in becoming his servant. I possess too many of his memories, including his mortal life as Dancer, to be entirely trustworthy.” Pust arrives and tells them they’re mad for eating Mogora’s cooking. Cutter tells Pust Mogora is happier without him and calls him “useless,” which makes Pust vanish back into the shadows. Apsalar warns him it isn’t smart to get between a husband and wife. Cutters asks her where she wants to go and when she says she hasn’t decided yet, he can tell she really has.</p><p>SCENE TWO</p><p>Trull thanks Ibra Gholan for the spear he has just given him. He tells Onrack he’s ready though he wishes they had some furs as the warren is cold. Onrack tells him they’ll travel in a few days from tundra to savanna to jungle. When Trull asks if he thinks they’ll beat the renegades to the First Throne, Onrack answers he thinks so as Tellann will be easy for their group but the path of chaos, which is “never straight” will slow the renegades. He adds that when they reach the Throne, they’ll have to defend it. Ibra and Monok frame Trull and Onrack on the march, indicating their continued distrust of them. Onrack and Trull agree that while they’re needed now, they’ll have to keep a sharp eye out when they no longer are. They move through tundra then marsh then bedrock then forest before stopping. When Ibra asks why, Onrack says it’s so Trull can rest, or has Ibra forgotten mortals need to. When Ibra says he hasn’t forgotten, Trull says, “It’s called indifference, Onrack. I am, after all, the least valuable member of this war party.” Monok asks Trull why the Edur have bowed before the Chained God. Ibra heads off to hunt as Trull begins to answer, beginning by saying he’s not the best taleteller as he is “Shorn. I no longer exist. To my brothers and my people, I never existed.” Onrack calls that “meaningless in the face of truth” and Monok says although the T’lan Imass have exiled their kind, “we still speak of them. We must speak of them, to give warning to others. What value a tale of it is not instructive?” Trull answers that is an “enlightened view But mine are not an enlightened people we care nothing for instruction. Nor, indeed, for truth. Our tales exist to give grandeur to the mundane. Or to give moments of great drama and significant and air of inevitability . . . Every defeat justifies future victory. Every victory is propitious. The Tiste Edur make no misstep, for our dance is one of destiny.” When he claims he was never in that dance, due to being shorn, Onrack says the exile has forced Trull to lie even to himself, to which Trull replies, “That is true. I am therefore forced to reshape the tale . . . There was much of that time that I did not understand at first—certainly not when it occurred. Much of my knowledge did not come to me until much later.” Onrack interrupts to say it happened after Trull’s shorning, and when Trull agrees, Onrack thinks, “As knowledge flowered before my mind’s eye in the wake of the Ritual of Tellann’s shattering.” Out loud he tells Trull to continue, and “if instruction can be found within [your tale] recognition is the responsibility of those to whom the tale is told. You are absolved of the necessity.” Monok, however, objects, arguing, “These words are spurious. Every story instructs. The teller ignores this truth at peril.” Trull says he will tell the tale of the Tiste Edur who lived north of Lether, save the one exception that he will tell it without “aggrandizement . . . reveling in glory . . . [or] claims of destiny or inevitability.” He says he’ll try to be “other than the Tiste Edur I appear to be, to tear away my cultural identity,” and when Monok interrupts to say “flesh does not lie . . . thus we are not deceived,” Trull responds “but the spirit can, Bonecaster. Instruct yourself in blindness and indifference—I in turn intend to attempt the same.” Monok wants to know when Trull will start telling his story, and Trull says at the Throne while they await the renegades and Edur. Ibra Gholan returns with a hare for Trull. Onrack is bothered by Trull’s words, bothered by the spiritual, emotional scarring Onrack hadn’t noticed beneath Trull’s outward steadiness and his physical scars left by the Shorning. He thinks Trull is “born of scars, of healing that left one insensate. His heart was incomplete. He is as a T’lan Imass . . . We ask that he resurrect his memories of life, then wonder at his struggle to satisfy our demands. The failure is ours, not his. We speak of those we have exiled, yet not to warn as Monok Ochen claims . . . We speak of them in reaffirmation of our judgment. But it is our intransigence that finds itself that finds itself fighting the fiercest war—with time itself, with the changing world around us.” Trull says when he begins, he will start with an observation about “nature and the exigency of maintaining a balance,” a statement that gives Onrack a chill. Trull continues: “Pressures and forces are ever in opposition. .. And the striving is ever towards a balance. This is beyond the gods, of course—it is the current of existence—but no, beyond even that, for existence itself is opposed by oblivion. It is a struggle that encompasses all, that defines every island in the Abyss . . . Life is answered by death. Dark by light. Overwhelming success by catastrophic failure. Horrific curse by breathtaking blessing. It seems the inclination of all people to lose sight of that truth.” He offers his small cookfire as an analogy, saying it serves his delight, but if he doesn’t put it out, “igniting this entire world will also kill everything in it, if not in flames, then in subsequent starvation.” Monok says he doesn’t see the point, and that “this prefaces nothing.” But Onrack says otherwise—”It prefaces everything”—support which Trull answers “with a smile. Of sadness overwhelming. Of utter despair. And the undead warrior was shaken.”</p><p>SCENE THREE</p><p>Lostara and Pearl continue into the desert, believing the fall of the Whirlwind means Tavore’s army had entered Raraku and were marching toward the oasis. Pearl senses “the goddess had drawn inward, concentrating her power for perhaps one final, explosive release. For the clash with the Adjunct. A singularity of purpose locked in rage, a flaw that could be exploited.” As for their “relationship,” Lostara thinks now that they’ve taken care of “long pent-up energies” they could move on, but Pearl appears to think differently and when he tried taking her by the hand, she clearly rejected the idea. They stop one ridge removed they think from the oasis. Pearl says he’s thinking of infiltrating the camps and causing trouble. Plus, he thinks the master of the Talons is in the camp, adding he now believes “the rebellion was compromised long ago, perhaps from the very start. The aim of winning independence . . . was not quite as central to some as it should have been . . . those hidden motives are about to be revealed. As he speaks, Lostara notes “an object lying among the cobbles—a momentary recognition, then her gaze quickly shifted away.” She asks Pearl if he’s considered he might be screwing up missions already in place, seeing as how neither the Empress nor Tavore know of his presence there. As he answers, she surreptitiously picks up the object. They continue on, walking over ground “littered with the tiny, shriveled bodies of countless desert creatures that had been swept up into the Whirlwind . . . They had rained down for a full day.” Pearl notes, “the Whirlwind has not been friendly to Raraku,” to which Lostara replies, “Assuming the desert cares one way or another, which it doesn’t, I doubt it will make much difference in the long run. A land’s lifetime is far vaster than anything with which we are familiar. .. Besides, Raraku is already mostly dead.” Pearl tries to argue otherwise, saying, “Appearances deceive. There are deep spirits in this Holy Desert,” but Lostar says he’s foolish to think the spirits care anything about the life atop the desert. He tells her she should respect the “mysteries of Raraku.” Pearl complains to Lostara that she seems to always create “discord.” Lostara answer that he thinks too much, saying she thinks “neither too much nor too little. I am perfectly balanced—this is what you find so attractive.” She says he’s like a capemoth drawn to the flame, and when he asks if she’s supposedly pushing him away for his own good, she says “fires neither push nor pull. They simply exist, compassionless, indifferent . . . That is another one of your flaws, Pearl. Attributing emotion where none exists.” She tells him to give it up, but when he says he’ll take her advice, she then tells him “gullibility is a most unattractive flaw,” which brings him close to explosion. As they near the final ridge, he asks her what she picked up and put in her pouch. She tosses it to the ground and tells him to look, but when he bends to do so she knocks him out. She picks him up and carries him down the slope (the oasis is only 2000 paces away), hiding when a group of desert warriors rides by, she recognizes them as Ashok Regiment, which she’d thought had been totally wiped out. When dusk falls, Cotillion comes out of the shadows. Lostara, who mentions that Cotillion had “recruited her” tells him Pearl was about to interfere and she knocked him out figuring that Cotillion wanted the path clear. But Cotillion says he thinks Pearl might actually be useful and tells her to make sure he’s awake tomorrow night. Just before he leaves to attend to “other tasks,” she tosses him the object she had picked up, saying she “assumed” it was his. Cotillion says it isn’t, but he knows who it does belong to and he is “pleased.” He asks if he can keep it and she says it doesn’t matter to her, but the way he tells her “Nor should it Lostara Yil,” makes her think “she had made a mistake in letting him keep the object; that, indeed it did matter to her, though for the present she not how.” Cotillion leaves.</p><p>SCENE FOUR (Lots of quoting in this one…)</p><p>Apsalar looks out a window of Pust’s temple: “She had never felt so alone, nor she realized so comfortable with that solitude. Changes had come to her. Hardened layers sheathing her soul had softened, found new shape in response to unseen pressures from within. Strangest of all, she had come, over time, to despise her competence, her deadly skills. They had been imposed upon her, forced into her bones and muscles. They had imprisoned her in blinding, gelid armor. And so, despite the god’s absence, she still felt as if she was two women, not one. Leading her to wonder with which woman Crokus had fallen in love. But no, there was no mystery there. He had assumed the guise of a killer . . . a dire reflection—not of Apsalar the fisher-girl, but of Apsalar the assassin, the cold murderer. In the belief that likeness would forge the deepest bond of all. Perhaps that would have succeeded, had she liked her profession . . . had it not felt like chains wrapped tight about her soul. She was not comforted by company within her prison. His love was for the wrong woman. . . And hers was for Crokus, not Cutter. And so they were together, yet apart, intimate yet strangers, and it seemed there was nothing they could do about it.” She thinks that the fisher-girl could not stand against the will of the assassin, just as Crokus “had similarly succumbed to Cutter.” Cotillion joins her and she tells him “would that you had taken all with you when you departed.” When he asks if she’d prefer he’d left her “bereft,” she says “No, innocent.” Cotillion tells her “Innocence is only a virtue, lass, when it is temporary. You must pass from it to look back and recognize its unsullied purity. To remain innocent is to twist beneath invisible and unfathomable forces all your life, until one day you realize that you no longer recognize yourself, and it comes to you that innocence was a curse that had shackled you, stunted you, defeated your every expression of living.” Apsalar replies, “But Cotillion, it is knowledge that makes one aware of his or her own chains.” Cotillion tells her “Knowledge only makes the eyes see what is there all along.” He adds she cannot “unmake yourself”, but she says she can choose to stop walking this particular path. He also tells her that he “walked in your bones, your flesh . . The fisher girl who became a women—we stood in each other’s shadow . . . It was difficult to remain mindful of my purpose. We were in worthy company . . . [Whiskeyjack’s] squad would have welcomed you. But I prevented them . . . Necessary, but not fair to you or them.” He tells her he needs to know her decision about Cutter and she says she doesn’t want Cotillion to do to Cutter what he did to her, he’s that important to “the fisher-girl whom he does not love . . . He loves the assassin and so chooses to be like her.” Cotillion says he now understands her struggle, but she’s wrong, Cutter is attracted to the assassin but does not lover her; he’s attracted to the power and ability to choose not to use power: “He is drawn to emulate what he sees as your hard-won freedom.” He tells her Cutter’s love didn’t come when she was Sorry, but after Cotillion had stopped possessing her. When Apsalar objects that love changes, Cotillion says it does, then makes a poor analogy with a capemoth, then tells her love “grows to encompass as much of the subject as possible. Virtues, flaws, limitations, everything—love will fondle them all, with child-like fascination.” When she begins to refer to the two women inside her, he tells her there are “multitudes, lass, and Cutter loves them all.” She says she doesn’t want Cutter to die and when he asks if that’s her decision, she says yes, though she knows what she must do. Cotillion tells her he is pleased, and when she asks why he says because he likes Cutter too. She inquires how brave he thinks she is and he responds “as brave as necessary.” She replies “again,” and he says “Yes, again.” She tells him he doesn’t seem much like a god and he tells her “I’m not a god in the traditional fashion. I’m a patron. Patrons have responsibilities. Granted, I rarely have the opportunity to exercise them.” She comments that he means, “they are not yet burdensome,” which evokes “a lovely smile.” He tells her she’s “worth far more for your lack of innocence,” and prepares to leave. Apsalar thanks him and asks him to take care of Cutter. He answers he will, “as if he were my own son.” He leaves, then soon afterward she does as well.</p><p>SCENE FIVE</p><p>Kalam hides in the petrified forest, surrounded by snakes. He senses a power, a presence in the forest, one that did not “belong on this world,” something “demonic.” He examines his otataral knife, thinking how few knew its full properties, or how its effects were unpredictable and varied if absorbed through the skin or via breathing it in. He also recalls a discovery made by accident, one which only a few survived, including him and Quick Ben—the discovery that otataral has a violent reaction to heat and to Moranth munitions: “But even that was not the whole secret. It’s what happens to hot otataral when you throw magic at it.” As he examines his other blade, an acorn drops down next to him. He looks up at the tree over him and says “Ah, an oak. Let it not be said I don’t appreciate the humor of the gesture . . . Just like old times, glad as always, that we don’t do this sort of thing anymore.”</p><p>SCENE SIX</p><p>Onrack and the others reach the jungle and begin to follow a game trail. Trull notes this probably isn’t the T’lan Imass’ nature territory and Onrack says he’s right; “We are a cold weather people. But this region exists within our memories. Before the Imass, there as another people, older, wilder. They dwelt where it was warm, and they were tall, their dark skins covered in fair hair. These we knew as the Eres. Enclaves survived into our time—the time captured within this warren . . . [They lived on] surrounding savannas. They worked in stone, but with less skill than us.” Monok adds, “All Eres were bonecasters for they were the first to carry the spark of awareness, the first so gifted by the spirits.” When Trull asks if they are gone, Monok says yes. Onrack says nothing, but thinks, “If Monok Ochem found reasons to deceive, Onrack could find none to contradict the bonecaster.” Trull changes the subject to ask if they’re close and if they’ll return to their own world if so. Onrack says yes, and begins to explain the First Throne lies at the “base of a crevasse beneath a city,” but Monok interrupts to say Trull needn’t know the name; he already knows too much. Trull says what he’s learned of the T’lan Imass isn’t particularly a secret: “You prefer killing to negotiation. You do not hesitate to murder gods when the opportunity arises. And you prefer to clean up your own messes . . . Unfortunately, this particular mess is too big, though I suspect you are still too proud to admit that.” He continues by saying besides, he’s not likely to survive the upcoming fight and in any case Monok will probably try to ensure that. Monok doesn’t disagree, and Onrack thinks he will try to defend Trull, anticipating that Monok and Ibra, knowing that, will probably try to take Onrack out first. The trail opens up to a clearing filled with bones and rotting flesh and flies. Monok explains, “The Eres did not fashion holy sites of their own . . . but they understood that there were places where death gathered, where life was naught but memories, drifting lost and bemused. And so such places they would often bring their own dead. Power gathers in layers—this is the birthplace of the sacred.” Trull asks if the Imass made this a gate then and when Monok answers yes, Onrack criticizes him for giving the T’lan Imass too much credit, telling Trull “Eres holy sites burned through the barriers of Tellann. They are too old to be resisted.” Trull wants to know if the Eres sites belong to Hood, since they’re connected to death, but Onrack tells him Hood didn’t yet exist when the sites were created, nor are the sites death-aspected: “Their power comes . . . from layers. Stone shaped into tools and weapons. Air shaped by throats. Minds that discovered, faint as flickering fires in the sky, the recognition of oblivion, of an end, to life, to love. Eyes that witnessed the struggle to survive and saw with wonder its inevitable failure. To know and understand that we all must die, Trull Sengar, is not to worship death. To know and to understand is itself magic, for it made us stand tall.” Trull points out that if that’s true, then the Imass have “broken the oldest laws of all, with your Vow.” Onrack tells him he is right, though his kin wouldn’t say so: “We are the first lawbreakers, and that we have survived his long is fit punishment. And so it remains our hope that the Summoner will grant us absolution.” Trull says, “Faith is a dangerous thing.” As they begin to use the gate, Onrack sees a tall, figure standing nearby, “with a fine umber-hued pelt and long, shaggy hair . . . A woman. Her breasts were large and pendulous, her hips wide and full.” He sees her move toward Trull, then all goes dark and he hears Trull shout. Before he can reach him, though, they travel. In their own realm again, he sees Trull lying unconscious, “blood smearing his lap . . . it did not belong to Trull Sengar, but to the Eres woman who had taken his seed. His first seed.” He looks more closely and see the blood is from “the fresh wound of scarification beneath [Trull’s] belly button. Three parallel cuts, drawn across diagonally, and the stained imprints of three more, likely those the woman had cut across her own belly.” Onrack asks Monok why the Eres took Trull’s seed and Monok answers he doesn’t know. When he starts to say the Eres are like beasts, Onrack points out this one had “intent” and Monok is forced to agree. He asks why Trull is still passed out and Onrack tells him Trull’s mind is “elsewhere . . . I came into contact with sorcery. That which the Eres projected . . . It was a warren, barely formed, on the very edge of oblivion. It was . . . like the Eres themselves. A glimmer of light behind the eyes.” They’re interrupted by Apt with Panek riding her, followed by a score of others. Panek asks if this group was all Logros could spare. Monok ignores the question and tells them they aren’t welcome, to which Panek replies “too bad, for we are here. To guard the First Throne.” Onrack asks who they are and who sent them and Panek identifies himself but says he can’t answer the second question. He adds he guards the outer ward, but the chamber “that is home to the First Throne possesses an inner warden—the one who commands us. Perhaps she can answer you.” They head that way.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Four</strong></p><p>SCENE ONE</p><p>Gamet looks over the camp area, not happy with it. He thinks the army is nervous over “Tavore’s headlong approach into the maw of the enemy, to the battleground of their choosing.” Gamet himself wonders if this march is “suggesting what, exactly? A single-mindedness worthy of imitation or a failure of imagination?” Keneb comments that Dom has prepared for them by building ramps, smoothing the ramps, etc. Gamet says they should assume what is obvious to them is equally obvious to Tavore, to which Keneb says it’d be nice to have some confirmation of that. Gamet reminds him there will be two meetings of the offices before dawn. The two discuss how Tavore has placed Keneb’s legion (one third of the army) in charge of preventing the enemy from retreating, “a premature assumption of victory that whispered of madness.” Gamet assumes Tavore will hold back the horse warriors as well due to lack of space and also to cover a Malazan retreat. Gamet leaves to meet Tavore. From where they stand, they can see the enemy and Tavore points out Dom and Reloe, saying that Reloe has been seeking Malazan sorcerers and that Nil and Nether are safe from such scrying because they are with her (and her otataral sword). She asks him how confident he thinks Dom is feeling. He answers that Dom’s confidence is probably “wilting” because it all seems too easy and too much in his favor. Glancing at the Wickan sorcerers, Gamet is startled by how much they have each grown. After a moment, Tavore announces Reloe has finished his questing and will need to leave to rest. She removes her sword to a distance and asks Gamet to spill a few drops of blood on the ground for a Nil/Nether ritual. The two speak of “spirits . . . rising with anger . . . A song . . . of war and warriors . . . New and old . . . so very new and so very old. Battle and death, again and again. The land remembers every struggle played out on its surface, on all its surfaces from the very beginning . . . The goddess is as nothing to this power—yet she would steal . . . the warren. She would claim this fragment and settle it upon the land like a parasite. Roots of shadow, slipping down to draw sustenance, to feed on the land’s memories. And the spirits will not have it.” Tavore asks if the spirits are resisting and the two nod yes, and Nil says, “Ghosts casts no shadows. You were right Adjunct. Gods, you were right.” Tavore wants to know if “they will suffice,” but Nil says he doesn’t know; it’s dependent on if “the Talon Master does what you think he will do.” And if Sha’ik doesn’t know of “the viper in her midst,” adds Nether, to which Tavore replies that if Sha’ik had known she would have killed him. Nether, though, wonders if Sha’ik and the goddess were merely waiting until “all their enemies were gathered.” Gamet is shaken by the ritual (“something had used him”) and can hear “distant music, a song of voices and unrecognizable instruments.” He asks to be dismissed and Tavore tells him to return to his legion and tell his officers that “Units may appear during the battle on the morrow which you will not recognize. They may seek orders, and you are to give them as if they were under your command.” He walks off, his headache worsening, feeling “the song seemed to have poisoned his veins, a music of flesh and bone that hinted of madness.” He thinks as he leaves, “Leave me to peace, damn you . I am naught but a soldier. A soldier.”</p><p>SCENE TWO</p><p>Fiddler sits on a boulder having tossed off his helmet. He feels “waves of pain that rose and fell like a storm-tossed sea . . . The song had burgeoned sudden and fierce in his skull.” Bottle uses sorcery to quest into him then to heal him by creating “a spreading silence. Blissful peace.” He looks up and finally is aware of his squad around him. When Bottle asks if Fiddler can hear him now, Fiddler says yes, but faintly, as if from a distance. Bottle and Fiddler are left alone and Bottle tells Fiddler that spirits are awakening and they came to Fiddler because of “Mortal blood has its own song. They remember it. They came to you Sergeant, eager to add their voices to it. To you.” When Fiddler asks why him Bottle says he doesn’t know, though Fiddler senses that is a lie and then asks, “You think it’s because I’m fated to die here at his battle. Bottle, unable to meet Fiddler’s eyes, says he’s not sure about much or what it has to do with Fiddler. Fiddler tells him “I’m a Bridgeburner, lad. The Bridgeburners were born here. In Raraku’s crucible.” Bottle points out that the Bridgeburners were wiped out and Fiddler says yes, they were. After some silence, Bottle says it won’t be the “usual battle” and Fiddler corrects him that there isn’t such a thing; “There’s nothing usual about killing and dying, about pain and terror.” When Bottle objects that isn’t what he meant, Fiddler says he knows, “But wars these days are fraught with sorcery and munitions, so you come to expect surprises.” The two cattle dogs from the Chain of Dogs pass by and Bottle says, “This place is complicated.” He picks up a rock and says “Eres ‘al. A hand-axe—the basin down there’s littered with them . . . Took days to make one of these, then they didn’t even use them—they just flung them into the lake . . . Why make a tool then not use it?” Fiddler asks what he’s talking about and Bottle explains the Eres, according to his grandmother, were “The Dwellers who lived in the time before the Imass, the first makers of tools, the first shapers of their world . . . I never expected to meet one—it was there, <em>she</em> was there in that song within you . . . I shared her mind. She was the one who gifted you the silence . . . I asked and she showed mercy.” When Bottle mentions the song again, Fiddler thinks of Kimloc, that “he did it anyway. He stole my story—not just mine, but the Bridgeburners’—and he made of it a song. The bastard’s gone and given us back to Raraku.” Fiddler thanks Bottle for his help and Bottle says he’ll pass it on to the Eres witch next time he meets her. As Bottle leaves, Fiddler wonders what Bottle hadn’t told him about the Eres witch that made him thinks he’d see her again. He also wonders if this will indeed be his last battle, if he was “being called to join the fallen Bridgeburners. Not so bad, then. Couldn’t ask for more miserable company. Damn, but I miss them. I miss them all. Even Hedge.” He looks over the basin and thinks “You too Kalam Mekhar. I wonder if you know why you’re here.”</p><p>SCENE THREE</p><p>In Leoman’s camp, a shaman finishes performing a ritual. Leoman asks what he saw and the shaman says armies and when Leoman says that’s pretty obvious, the shaman says “No. More armies!” Leoman tells Corabb to go to Sha’ik and find out how Mathok’s tribes will be set up. The shaman screams, “They are here! The dogs, Leoman! The dogs! The Wickan dogs!” Leoman thinks him crazy. On the way, Corabb finds Leoman’s previous messenger dead on the trail. As he continues on, he feels two sharp blows against his back nearly knocking him off the horse. He regains his mount and rides on, realizing that what had saved him was that the two crossbow bolts fired at him had struck the lance shaft he was wearing on his back.</p><p>SCENE FOUR</p><p>Heboric thinks Scillara’s mind is clearing of the durhang. He tells her he wants to find L’oric and wants her to go with them, and then they’ll go to Felisin. He tells her no one is going to command or manipulate her, and she tells him “very well, lead me into the darkness.” He answers, “I shall, as soon as it arrives.”</p><p>SCENE FIVE</p><p>Sha’ik looks at the Malazan army digging in, then at Dom also watching the Malazans. She thinks now that they’re all in place it all seems so “pointless. The game of murderous tyrants, pushing their armies forward into an inevitable clash. Coldly disregarding of the lives that would be lost in the appeasement of their brutal desires. What value this mindless hunger to rule? What do you want with us, Empress Lassen! Seven Cities will never rest easy beneath your yoke. You shall have to enslave, and what is gained by that? And what of her own goddess? Was she any different from Laseen? Every claw was outstretched, eager to grasp, to rend, to soak the sand red with gore. But Raraku does not belong to you, dear Dryjhna . . . This desert is holy unto itself. And not it rails . . . against one and all.” Mathok interrupts her thoughts to point out Tavore across the way. Sha’ik comments on Reloe’s failed attempt to find Tavore’s High Mages or “unsuspected allies” but blocked by the sword, he finds only a few squad mages. Mathok identifies Nil and Nether and when Sha’ik says they were “broken of spirit” by the Chain of Dogs, he wonders if they might not be more capable than thought since Tavore is hiding them in her sword’s shadow. Sha’ik says perhaps it is simply to hide their weakness or to sow doubt. But then Reloe leaves and Sha’ik feels the surprising power of the Wickans’ ritual: “the goddess within her flinched back—as if stung . . . for Raraku was answering the summons, a multitude of voices, rising in song, rising in raw, implacable desire—the sound, Sha’ik realized, of countless souls straining against the chains that bound them. Chains of shadow. Chains like roots. From this torn, alien fragment of warren. This piece of shadow that has risen to bind their souls and so feeds upon the life force.” She asks Mathok where Leoman is, knowing suddenly that they need him. She spies Dom, “studying the enemy with an air of supreme confidence that made Sha’ik want to scream. Nothing—<em>nothing</em> was as it seemed.” The sun drops down in a “crimson conflagration. The day was drowning in a sea of flame, and she watched shadows flowing across the land, her heart growing cold.”</p><p>SCENE SIX</p><p>Exiting his tent, Heboric asks Scillara if she hears what he does. At first she says it’s the wind but then, realizing there is none, listens then says “a song. From far away—the Malazan army, do you think?” He shakes his head no, but says nothing. The streets are empty, due to fear Heboric believes. Scillara wonders where the girls are, Bidithal’s spies. Heboric realizes with them gone, Bidithal is blind. He tells her “There will be events this night. Blood will be spilled. The players are, no doubt, even now drawing into position.” She replies that Bidithal had told her the world would change this night, and Heboric calls him a fool sunk in the Abyss. Scillara tells him Bidithal “dreams of true Darkness . . . Shadow is but an upstart, a realm born of compromise and filled with imposters. The fragments must be returned to the First Mother.” To which Heboric answers that Bidithal is worse than a fool; he is mad, mad to think he is a force “worthy” to involve himself in “the most ancient of battles.” She warns him that Bidithal had said something was coming that only Bidithal “has any hope of controlling . . for he alone remembers the Dark.” As they turn to head to Bidithal’s temple, two of Dom’s killers appear but are quickly slain by Heboric. Then three crossbow bolts take him down, wounding him badly. He tells her to flee to the stone forest and she does. A trio of killers close in and as Heboric waits for the final blow, there is silence then someone standing over him and someone else standing near his feet. The assassins tell the “wraiths” to leave, but the newcomers answers “Too late for that assassin . . . Besides, we’ve only just arrived.” One of the assassins tries to banish the wraiths in the name of Hood, but the ghost just laughs and replies “Kneel before Hood do you? Oh yes, I felt the power in your words. Alas, Hood’s out of his depth on this one. Ain’t that right, lass?” The other ghost grunts in agreement. The assassin gives a final warning, saying their “sanctioned” blades will “bleed your souls.” The ghost says that’s assuming the blades will ever touch them, and when the assassin responds there are “but two of you and three of us,” the ghost simply replies “Two?” Heboric hears the sound of a scuffle, then blood spraying on the ground. One of his saviors says they should have kept an assassin alive to send back to “that fly-blown Napan bastard with a promise for the morrow” but the first says it’s better this way to keep the surprise. One ghost wonders if Heboric will live and another says since he’s Treach’s Destriant, probably. They hear Scillara returning and leave, saying to each other that they won’t surprise anyone else until the dawn. Scillara arrives and tells Heboric there were soldiers there that “didn’t look too good.” Heboric says never mind them and has her pull the quarrels out so he can heal, then drag him back to his temple. He blacks out.</p><p>SCENE SEVEN</p><p>Sha’ik stares down on the armor of her predecessor, which includes a full visored helm, overly large with a web of chain over the eye-slits. She puts it on (its magically lightened), all save the gauntlets and helm, then pauses, wondering: “Have I any choice in all this? The goddess remained a towering presence in her mind, rooted through every muscle and fiber, her voice whispering in the flow of blood in her veins and arteries. Ascendant power was in Sha’ik’s grasp, and she knew she would use it when the time came. Or, rather, it would use her. To kill her sister.” L’oric enters her tent wearing white armor. He mentions the more than 300 warriors Mathok has set to guard her palace and when she says Mathok is overly cautious, that the Malazans are far away, he replies that it isn’t the Malazans that Mathok worries about. She answers, “The goddess protects me. I have nothing to fear.” He warns her there will be a convergence this night, that ascendants are gathering, that treachery is “in the air,” that “Raraku is awakening.” She waves it all off, saying, “None of it matters. I cannot be touched. Nor will the goddess be denied . . . The rage of the goddess consumes all, L’oric. If you can hear the voice of the Holy Desert, then it is Raraku’s death-cry. The Whirlwind shall devour this night. And any ascendant power foolish enough to approach will be annihilated. The goddess, L’oric, will not be denied.” L’oric looks at her, than “seemed to sag beneath is armor. He drew a hand across his eyes, as if seeking to claw some nightmarish vision from his sight.” Before he leaves, a pair of guards drag Corabb in. He tells her he is the third and only surviving messenger from Leoman, that assassins have been behind him the whole way. She calls for Mathok and has L’oric heal Corabb of his exhaustion. Sha’ik then orders Corabb to return, escorted, to Leoman and tell him to come back and assume command. She orders L’oric to inform Dom of this. He leaves, making his warren visible to potential enemies. He passes through the reserve trenches where the Dogslayers are, thinking how they had “made of themselves a separate force. Marked by the butchery of their deeds. By the focus of Malazan outrage. They know that no quarter will be given them . . . Their lives were in Korbolo Dom’s stained hands. Entirely. They will not sleep this night.” He wonders if they will mutiny if Leoman tries to assume command and thinks maybe Sha’ik waited too long, though he also considers the possibility that she did so on purpose so Dom would be caught by surprise, with no time to counter her move. He tells the guards outside Dom’s tent he’s come from Sha’ik, and the sorceress Henaras comes out to tell him he has to release his warren first. He agrees to, saying he is under her protection. She asks protection from whom and he simply smiles. Inside, Dom sits in a huge chair: “The high headrest was carved in arcane symbols that L’oric recognized—with a shock—as Hengese, from the ancient city of Li Heng in the heart of the Malazan Empire. Dominating the carvings was a stylized rendition of a raptor’s talons, outstretched, that hovered directly over [Dom’s] head. Dom calls L’oric a fool for coming to him, though he adds, “Granted, you might have assumed we were allies.” L’oric begins to say Sha’ik demands Dom’s presence but Dom interrupts, “To relieve me of my command, yes. With the ill-informed belief that my Dogslayers will accept Leoman.” L’oric asks if Dom will betray the Apocalypse and when Dom says “if Sha’ik insists,” L’oric responds it’s the Goddess he needs to worry about, “and I believe her toleration of you is about to end.” Dom, though, says he doubts the goddess will destroy the Dogslayers, her own army. L’oric pauses a moment, then answers “I see now the flaw. You have approached this tactically, as would any soldier. But what you clearly do not understand is that the Whirlwind Goddess is indifferent to tactics, to grand strategies. You rely upon her common sense but she <em>has none</em>. The battle tomorrow? Victory or defeat? The goddess cares neither way. She desires <em>destruction</em>. The Malazans butchered on the field, the Dogslayers slaughtered in their trenches, an enfilade of sorcery to transform the sands of Raraku into a red ruin. This is what the Whirlwind Goddess desires.” Dom scoffs, saying the goddess can’t reach him in this “sanctified place,” but L’oric can see him sweating and calls him a fool, saying the goddess won’t bother with him herself. When Dom asks if L’oric refers to himself, L’oric says he’s not even a messenger, just the “voice of common sense . . . It is not who she will send against you, Supreme Commander. It is, I believe, who she will allow through her defenses.” Dom gestures and a knife strikes L’oric from behind. Not a killing blow because L’oric never fully released his defenses, his “innermost layers of Kurald Thyrllan,” but he is driven to his knees, “bleeding into the weave.” As he hears Dom shouting orders, he thinks, “Blood is the path, you foolish man. And you have opened it. You poor bastard.”</p><p>SCENE EIGHT</p><p>Greyfrog tells Felisin he has to leave her due to “an invitation from my brother.” To her question about whether L’oric was in trouble, he says “There is darkness this night, yet the Mother’s face is turned away. What comes cannot be chained . . . My brother can come to no further harm, but my path is made clear. Glee. I shall eat humans this night . . . The shadows are fraught—no path is entirely clear, even that of blood.” He tells her to stay in the grove until dawn and that a potential ally is coming. Scillara arrives, saying Heboric sent her, adding that assassins tried to kill him and he is healing in his tent/temple.</p><p>SCENE NINE</p><p>The Tiste Liosan overlook the oasis. That withdraw so as not to be noticed by Karsa passing by: He was huge . . . Astride a horse to match. And a thousand ravaged souls trailed him, bound by ethereal chains that he dragged as if indifferent to their weight. A sword of stone hung from his back, and it was possessed by twin spirits raging with bloodthirst.” After he passes, Jorrude tells the others the trespassers are camped in the Malazan army and at dawn the Liosan will strike them. As they head into the hills, Jorrude checks to make sure Karsa hadn’t seen them hiding, thinking “Hiding. Yes, that is the truth of it, ignoble as the truth often proves to be.” He thanks Osric Karsa hadn’t seen them.</p><p>SCENE TEN</p><p>Karsa watches the Liosan ride away, thinking “there were enemies aplenty awaiting him in the oasis, and no night lasted forever. Alas.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Five</strong></p><p>SCENE ONE</p><p>Febryl sits on the ridge, his warren spread out across the whole oasis, expanding and enhancing his senses. He feels powers converging, Dom’s assassins heading out on their assigned tasks, Reloe returning from his journey, the Malazans digging in. He’s bothered however, by a “strange song…the voice of Raraku itself”; the sensation that Hood himself is near, masking “other presences”; and the stirring of sprites and ghosts. He looks forward to “yet another apocalypse on Raraku’s restless sands.”</p><p>SCENE TWO</p><p>L’oric’s body has been dragged to the side of the command tent and left for dead. He hears Dom give his several orders</p><ul><li>Henaras is to release his assassins to kill all of Bidithal’s spies and Scillara</li><li>Durly is to ride to Tavore and deliver Dom’s message and to impress on her the need to call back her own killers, “lest they do the Whirlwind Goddess’s work for her.”</li><li>The 4<sup>th</sup> company and Fayelle are to block Leoman’s return</li><li>Ethume is to be within crossbow range of Febryl</li></ul><p>Henaras says she feels “terrible powers” nearing, to which Dom replies that’s why they need Tavore and her sword. He asks if they’re safe in the tent and Henaras says she thinks so due to the wards set up by her, Fayelle, and Reloe. L’oric is distracted by the sound of one of Dom’s guards outside being killed, then Greyfrog slices through the bottom of the tent wall nearby. He grabs L’oric and pulls him out, telling him “things are coming. Suitably ominous. Frankly, I admit to fear and advise we hide.” L’oric agrees and tells Greyfrog to leave him somewhere safe then return to guard Felisin from assassins.</p><p>SCENE THREE</p><p>Kesanal, one of Dom’s assassins, is looking at Scillara and Felisin. He signals to his hunting group to encircle the women, then beings and incantation to dull the intended victims. He and his squad step forward once the incantation works and then are killed suddenly by Karsa. Kesanal finds himself next looking at Hood’s Gate, heading toward it with his four kinsmen/associates.</p><p>SCENE FOUR</p><p>As Felisin and Scillara struggle to recover, Karsa asks where Bidithal and a list of others (Leoman, Febryl, Dom, Reloe, Heboric) are. Felisin, still dulled and also shocked and horrified by the ease and speed with which Karsa had killed the five assassins, can’t even speak. Scillara tells Karsa to find them where he can. Karsa leaves. Felisin whispers he’s going to kill all he named saved Leoman.</p><p>SCENE FIVE</p><p>Mathok looks down at two corpses—the most recent assassins sent to kill him. He orders T’morol to gather the clan, goes to get the Book of Dryjhna that Sha’ik had entrusted to him, then rejoins T’morol and the clan and tells them they are riding to Leoman. The rest of the clans are to guard Sha’ik. T’morol asks if they will wait and watch what happens at dawn to “gauge the wind.” Mathok says yes.</p><p>SCENE SIX</p><p>Heboric feels Febryl’s web torn by the several forces moving through it. He senses ghosts in the city and gods coming near to “witness all that was to come. Witness, or to seize the moment and act directly. A nudge here, a tug there, if only to appease their egos, if only to see what happens.” He thinks how “these were the games he despised, source of his fiercest defiance all those years ago. The shape of his crime, if crime it was. And so they took my hands.” He realizes he is “indifferent to Treach, [is] a reluctant Destriant to the new god of war despite the gifts [of his new hands]…Otataral Island and the giant of jade—that is what awaits me. The returning of power. Even as those last words tracked across his mind, he knew that a deceit rode among them. A secret he knew but to which he would fashion no shape. Not yet.” He exits his tent.</p><p>SCENE SEVEN</p><p>Kalam tucks the acorn he’d been tossed into his sash and heads out, feeling the song inside him, as well as the awakening of powers in the oasis before him. He enters the oasis and comes across a hand of assassins, wondering who in the camps would organize them in such fashion. He tracks them and notes how they move slightly differently than a Claw Hand. Realizing they are Talons, he wonders if this is what Cotillion wanted him to confirm. He kills them all, whispering in the last’s ear “If your masters are listening, and they should be, compliments of the Claw. See you soon.” He assumes their target is inside the building they’d been heading toward. He moves toward it, coming across the corpses of three young girls and two blood trails leading away toward the temple. He tracks the trails into the temple, sensing as he nears it that despite its age and ruined appearance, it has been newly sanctified. Inside he comes across another corpse, this one killed by magic, and he sees shadows farther in. He pulls out his otataral knife. Inside a young girl sits surrounded by three other corpses; she asks him if he remembers the dark. Kalam tells her not to move and she’ll live. Bidithal, at the far end of the inner pit, tells him her mind is gone. He adds that he is not Kalam’s enemy and in fact, the one trying to kill Bidithal is Dom and Reloe. He asks if Kalam (whom Bidithal knows only as a Claw) wants directions to their tent. When Kalam says he’ll find it himself, soon, Bidithal warns him that his otataral blade is not enough inside this temple, saying that though Kalam may think he knows the temple’s nature, he is “in error.” He orders Silgar to give Kalam some wine. Silgar squirms across the floor; he has a silver tray strapped to his back with a jug on it. Bidithal apologizes for Silgar’s slowness, then introduces himself as “arch-priest of all that is sundered, broken, wounded, and suffering. My own awakening proved both long and torturous…had fashioned in my own mind every detail of the cult I would lead. All the while unaware that the shaping was being guided…even when the fated new House was laid out before me, I did not realize the truth. This shattered fragment of Kurald Emurlahn, Claw, shall not be the plaything of a desert goddess. Nor of the Empress. None of you shall have it, for it shall become the heart of the new House of Chains. Tell your empress to stand aside. We are indifferent to who would rule the land beyond the Holy Desert. She can have it. You can have her [Sha’ik] as well. Marched back to Unta in chains—and that is far more poetic than you will ever know.” Kalam tells Bidithal the offer is interesting, but he feels it’s filled with more lies than truth. Bidithal says perhaps Kalam is right, as Bidithal needs Sha’ik for another day. But he insists he would work with Kalam to deal with Febryl and Dom, telling him Dom calls himself Master of the Talon and plans on “returning to Laseen’s embrace…[using] Sha’ik to bargain for his own position. As for Febryl…what he awaits no one but he is mad enough to desire.” Kalam wonders why all the talk as Bidithal has no plans to let him leave alive. He adds that the Hounds of Darkness are coming and asks of Bidithal summoned them, if he or the Crippled God think to control them and if so, he calls them mad. Bidithal says the Hounds “seek a master.” Kalam thinks to himself “Cotillion was right about the Chained One,” and out loud replies “One who is worthy…meaner and tougher than they are. And in this oasis, they will find no such individual…They will kill everyone.” Bidithal tells Kalam he has no idea of Bidithal’s power, but says Kalam was right about not leaving alive; Bidithal’s just been waiting for his shadow servant to return. He says he will now leave for he “made a promise to Sha’ik and I mean to keep it,” adding that if by some miracle Kalam survives, Bidithal won’t stop him from going after Dom and the others. Bidithal disappears in darkness and Kalam has a momentary shiver at the “uncanny familiarity of the sorcerous departure” before the shadows attack. It turns out his otataral blade was enough, with the assistance of Cotillion.</p><p>SCENE EIGHT</p><p>Karsa has killed numerous of Dom’s killers, though some had knives invested with sorcery. He enters Heboric’s tent but finds it empty, as is Leoman’s pit. He goes to Bidithal’s and hears fighting inside. As he watches, Silgar crawls out, right to Karsa’s feet. Silgar says “He fights like a demon…Both blades cut through the wraiths…A god stands at his shoulders.” He tells Karsa to kill them both and when Karsa says he takes no orders from him, Silgar calls him a fool and says, “We are brothers in the House now, you and I. You are the Knight of Chains and I am the Leper. The Crippled God has chose us. And Bidithal, he has become the Magi…he wisely fled and I am doing. The Claw and his patron god are even now slaying the last of his shadow servants. You are the Knight—you possess your own patron. . . Kill the enemy, it is what you must do.” Karsa agrees, and kills Silgar, thinking as he sees it done that “Leoman was right long ago—a quick death would have been the better choice.” He lifts his sword free of Silgar’s corpse and says, “I follow no patron god.” He starts to track Bidithal.</p><p>SCENE NINE</p><p>Corabb heads back to Leoman’s camp with an escort of 20 of Mathok’s warriors. To Corabb’s surprise, the escort is stopped at the perimeter; Leoman has ordered none from the oasis is allowed in. Corabb tells Leoman Sha’ik wants him to replace Dom as commander. Corabb confirms that Dom’s assassins are between them and her but says they won’t challenge the entire force. When he says Dom didn’t know yet but that Sha’ik had demanded his presence, Leoman says Dom will simply ignore her, and that in fact Dom probably does know. He asks if Corabb thinks the Dogslayers will follow someone other than Dom and Corabb says they’ll have no choice since it is Sha’ik’s order. Leoman nods then orders his men to break camp, saying they ride to Sha’ik.</p><p>SCENE TEN</p><p>Kalam exits the temple, shaken by what he’d witnessed of Cotillion’s skills. He thinks he had done with Cotillion had asked of him: “he had found the source of the threat to the realm of Shadow. Or at least confirmed a host of suspicions. This fragment of Kurald Emurlahn will be the path to usurpation by none other than the Crippled God. The House of Chains had come into play.” He thinks that’s Cotillion and Shadowthrone’s problem though; he had “more immediate tasks.” Considering them, he is glad Cotillion had “been kind enough to deliver a pair of Kalam’s favorite weapons.” He sees Silgar’s corpse and thinks it looks like the wound had been delivered by an Imass sword. He heads for where he thinks Dom would be set up, moving through “heavy layers of sorcery…seeming to flow in streams.” He reaches Dom’s fortified area and watches as a troop heads out quietly. He wonders at their purpose, but is happy to have fewer soldiers in the encampment, though he’s sure Dom has left himself still well-protected: “He calls himself master of the Talon after all. Not that Cotillion, who was Dancer, knows a damned thing about them. Sparing the revelation only a sneer. Kalam sneaks into the camp and makes his way to just outside the command tent. He pulls out a pair of Claw crossbows then watches as Reloe appears out of a portal and enters the tent with three assassins. Suddenly, a hand settles on Kalam’s soldier and someone tells him to keep eyes forward. Kalam “knew that voice, from more years back than he’d like to think. But that bastard’s dead. Dead before Surly took the throne.” As he pictures the “acid-spattered face,” the voice continues: “Granted…no love’s lost between me and the company I’m sharing again. Figured I’d seen the last of ever damn one of them and you…Need a way in there, right? Best we mount a diversion. Give us fifty heartbeats. At least you can count those.” The ghost leaves and Kalam wonders what is happening, “That damned captain went renegade. They found his body in Malaz City the morning after the assassinations or something closely approximating his body.” As he looks at the tent, he hears screams and Moranth munitions, then the guards head away, leaving two visible ones. He kills them then enters the tent to face a Pardu assassin who, seeing him, says “Kalam Mekhar. I suppose you don’t remember me.” Kalam kills him then says “No I don’t.” Reloe and the other two assassins appear. Reloe says they’d expected a Claw attack, though not, he confesses, a ghost one as well. Reloe can’t use magic due to Kalam’s otataral blade. One of the assassins says Kalam would probably take them singly but not together. Kalam says he’s right, then tosses his acorn to the ground. The three flinch as it rolls toward them, then when nothing happens one of the assassins kicks it away. Kalam kills the assassins with his crossbows. Reloe suddenly shrieks and is fatally attacked by sorcery. Quick Ben steps out from where the acorn had rolled to and, kneeling beside the dying Reloe, tells him “It’s disloyalty that bothers us the most…We always answer it. Always have. Always will.” Kalam notices that Quick looks “older. Worn down. Scars not written on his skin, but on his heart. He will, I suspect, have nothing good to tell me when all this is done.” He asks if Quick had caused the diversion and the mage says no, “Nor did Hood, though the hoary bastard’s arrived. This is all Raraku.” He says he’ll explain later, then standing, warns Kalam that Henaras is with Dom in the back area, behind some tough wards. Kalam says that’s fine, drawing his otataral blade. But when they enter, they find Henaras’ corpse laid out on the map table; atop her chest was a single pearl. The continue on to find Dom in his chair. His voice filled with fear, he tells them he has already sent a message to Tavore saying he’s ready to attack Sha’ik with his army. Kalam says if Dom thinks he and Quick Ben are Tavore’s reply, he’s wrong. Dom says he and Reloe had thought the mage was either dead with the rest of the Bridgeburners or still on Genabackis. Quick answers that Tayschrenn sent him ahead while he used his sorcery to speed Dujeck’s fleet to Seven Cities, adding they’d arrived in Ehrlitan a week ago. Dom says, “What’s left of those legions, you mean.” Kalam is blindsided, thinking “The Bridgeburners dead? Whiskeyjack! Onearm’s Host—gods below, what happened over there?” Dom starts to negotiate, saying they can work together to pacify Seven Cities and bring Sha’ik in chains to Laseen. Quick interrupts to say if Dom thinks he’ll get a pardon he’s insane and when Dom suddenly attacks him, Kalam simply knocks him out. As he starts to tie him up in preparation for bringing him someplace Quick has thought of, he asks about the Bridgeburners and Whiskeyjack. Quick tells him “Dead. Barring Picker and a handful of others,” adding he’ll tell him all of it later. Kalam says he feels like killing, but Quick says not Dom, not now. Kalam thinks, “Hold back on the feelings Kalam Mekhar. Hold back on everything. Quick’s right. In time. In time. Oh, Whiskeyjack.”</p><p>SCENE ELEVEN</p><p>Bidithal moves toward Sha’ik’s palace, thinking he needs her and the goddess and that “Once the goddess’ rage has cooled, has annealed in to beauty by victory—we can still achieve this. But I know now what Febryl has done. I know what Korbolo Dom and Kamist Reloe plan for the dawn.” He hears screams from the Dogslayer’s camp and thinks Kalam has made it there. He sights the palace and considers what he needs to do: “Counter the Napan’s gambit—awaken the goddess to the threat awaiting her. Then hunt down that gnarled bhok’aral Febryl and see his skin stripped… even the goddess, yes even the goddess will have to recognize me. My power. When flanked by my new pets.” His musings are rudely interrupted by Karsa picking him up and throwing him to the ground. He looks up to see Karsa standing over him, surrounded by “gathering ghosts, chained souls.” Karsa tells him, “You should have left her alone.” Bidithal screams “We are both servants of the same god…I would save Sha’ik!” Karsa tears away Bidithal’s sex organs and as Bidithal dies, he looks up to see Karsa watching and thinks “You fool, Toblakai.” Karsa shoves the organs into Bidithal’s mouth, saying “For you Bidithal. For every nameless girl-child you destroyed. Here. Choke on your pleasure.” Bidithal then finds himself before Hood’s Gate, “And there, gathered by the Lord of Death, waited demons who were of like nature to Bidithal himself, gleefully closing about the new victim. A lifetime of vicious pleasure. An eternity of pain in answer. For even Hood understood the necessity for balance.”</p><p>SCENE TWELVE</p><p>Lostara begins to head out, but Cotillion appears and tells her to stay. She tells him she woke Pearl as he’d said to do and he then went into the oasis. Cotillion replies Pearl is returning because he senses what is nearing. She asks if it’s what is making Cotillion hide with her and he answers “There are times when it is advisable to step back and wait. The Holy Desert itself senses the approach of an ancient foe and will rise in answer if need be. Even more precarious, the fragment of Kurald Emurlahn that the Whirlwind Goddess would claim is manifesting itself. The goddess is fashioning a portal, a gate, one massive enough to swallow this entire oasis. Thus she too makes a play for Raraku’s immortal heart. The irony is that she herself is being manipulated by a far cleverer god, who would take this fragment for himself and call it his House of Chains.” Lostara says she doesn’t much care; she and Pearl are there for Felisin. Cotillion tells her they’ve found her, but she is beyond them “For the moment.” She says they’ll just wait for the path to clear and he says, yes, just as he’d said. He leaves.</p><p>SCENE THIRTEEN</p><p>Febryl had killed all of Dom’s assassins that tried to kill him. He senses Dom and Reloe are dead. He waits for the “oasis behind him to become as a nightmare wakened into horrid reality…everything was proceeding perfectly.” Karsa suddenly appears and kills him.</p><p>SCENE FOURTEEN</p><p>Karsa can feel Urugal’s voice screaming in his head, trying to push him away from the oasis, but he doesn’t like being pushed. He turns to face the oasis and can feel “a thousand ghostly chains stretched taut behind him begin pulling. The Teblor growled under his breath and leaned forward. I am the master of these chains. I, Karsa Orlong, yield to none. Not gods, not the souls I have slain. I will walk forward now, and either resistance shall end, or the chains will be snapped.” He hears a pair of howls and thinks, “Ahh, they have arrived.” He moves forward, the chains no longer resisting.</p><p>SCENE FIFTEEN</p><p>Gamet lies in agony on his cot, his head in incredible pain. He blacks out, then finds himself armored, pain-free near the tent exit. He feels he needs to go out, to get his horse. He mounts and rides out, joining three figures at the ridge: Nil, Nether, Grub. Grub tells him the Wickans and Malazans will take the flanks, but Gamet will ride straight up the main ramp. Gamet sees an army preparing to do so and when Grub tells him to ride to them, he salutes and does so. A dragon-helmed rider asks Gamet to join them and when Gamet says he cannot—as Fist is must command—the rider replies “Not this night. Fight at our sides as the soldier you are. Remember the old battles? When all that was required was the guarding of the companions flanking you. Such will be this night. Leave the commanding to the lords. Ride with us in freedom. And glory. Gamet feels his blood racing and draws his sword, saying he will ride with them. He notes the banner—a clan of the Burned Tears—then notes their “archaic and half-rotting” armor. They attack the unprepared Dogslayers and Gamet hears “Screams on all sides, strangely muted, almost faint. Sounds of battle, yet they seemed a league distant.” As they rout the Dogslayers, butterflies descend “in swarms, to flit above the carnage in the trenches.” He notices how the Dogslayers offer almost no defense, sees their horror, “the terror in their faces as he and his comrades delivered death. He could hear the battle song now, rising and falling like waves on a pebbled shore, yet building towards a climax yet to come—yet to come, but soon. Soon. Yes, we’ve needed a song. We’ve waited a long time for such a song. To honor our deeds. Our struggles. Our lives and our deaths. We’ve needed our own voice, so that our spirits could march, march ever onward. To battle. To war. Manning these walls of crumbled brick and sand. Defending the bone-dry harbors and the dead cities that once blazed with ancient dreams, that once flickered life’s reflection on the warm, shallow sea. Even memories need to be defended. Even memories.” The rider who had asked him to join rides up beside him and reveals herself to be a “dark-skinned woman, her eyes a stunning blue within a web of desert lines.” When he says there are still more enemies, she laughs and says not the tribes for they are kin. She says their battle is done; others will fight tomorrow. Now they ride to the shore and she again asks if he will join them. He says yes and she inquires again, asking if he would leave his friends. He answers, “For you, yes” and she smiles. He looks at all the dead Dogslayers and thinks “Vengeance. She will be pleased. She will understand and be pleased. As am I. Goodbye, Adjunct Tavore.”</p><p>SCENE SIXTEEN</p><p>Koryk asks Fiddler [note the shift to calling him Fiddler] what he’s looking at and Fiddler, wiping his eyes, says “Nothing, or nothing that makes sense.” Koryk says they aren’t going to see battle in the morning, are they and Fiddler tells him “The glory of battle, Koryk, dwells only in the bard’s voice, in the teller’s woven words. Glory begins to ghosts and poets. What you hear and dream isn’t the same as what you live—blur the distinction at your own peril, lad.” When Koryk asks why Fiddler is there then, Fiddler says he thinks the song called him, and that while Quick Ben probably knows more about it, Fiddler thinks the song means the Bridgeburners have ascended, “at least, the dead ones. The rest of us, we’re just malingering. Here in the moral realm.” Koryk asks if Fiddler’s planning on dying anytime soon and when Fiddler answers no, he says good, “Because we like our sergeant.” He leaves and Fiddler turns his attention back to the battle, feeling “as if friends are fighting. I can almost hear sounds of battle. Almost.” Then two howls pierce the night and “the darkness above the oasis began to change.”</p><p>SCENE SEVENTEEN</p><p>Mathok and Leoman meet. Mathok tells him “Raraku has awakened. Ghosts have risen, the Holy Desert’s own memories. When Leoman asks who are their enemies, Mathok replies “Betrayal upon betrayal, Leoman.” He says he’s set his clans between the Malazans and Sha’ik, but he fears the battle is already lost. When he adds he’s brought the Holy Book, Leoman asks “To Y’Ghatan?” Mathok says yes; his tribe will go with him and he’ll leave behind nine thousand others for Leoman to command. Leoman says no, he has no choice or time to modify the tactics. He asks about Sha’ik and Mathok says the goddess still holds her, even Dom’s assassins can’t get to her. Leoman though believes Dom would have anticipated that and planned something else. He tells Mathok he rides to Sha’ik. Mathok’s says the Holy Book was a history, not a prophecy. Leoman says he knows, and the two say farewell. As Leoman’s group heads through the defile, they are attacked. Leoman jumps on Corabb’s horse and the two ride on.</p><p>SCENE EIGHTEEN</p><p>Quick Ben and Kalam dodge a group of heavy infantry ghosts. Kalam asks if they’re the ones singing and Quick says he hears the song in his head as well. He explains it’s a Tanno Spiritwalker song for the Bridgeburners: A Tanno stole our tale and fashioned a song—but for that song to have any effect, the Bridgeburners had to die. As a company. And now it has. Barring you and me.” Kalam interrupts to say Fiddler too, then recalls Fiddler saying something about a Spiritwalker in Ehrlitan. Quick says however it happened, the Bridgeburners have ascended, though he doesn’t know what that means—”I’ve never heard of such a thing before. A whole company—there’s no precedent for this.” Kalam asks what about the T’lan Imass, and Quick says, “An interesting thought…In any case, Raraku’s ghosts have risen on that song. Risen to battle. But there’s more. I swear I saw a Wickan standard back near the Dogslayer trenches.” Kalam wonders if Tavore’s taking advantage of the chaos, but Quick says she knows nothing of it due to her sword and the darkness hiding everything: “the darkness is sorcery. Remember whenever Anomander Rake arrived someplace with is warren unveiled…This is more primal.” Kalam mentions the Hounds,” like the Shadow Hounds, only somehow worse.” Quick thinks then says “Two Hounds of Darkness. The Deragoth then. So who broke their chains I wonder.” Kalam wonders what there is that Quick doesn’t know and the mage says he doesn’t know what they Hounds are doing here. Kalam takes that “here” as general, but Quick means it in the literal sense.</p><p>SCENE NINETEEN</p><p>The Hounds are as large, but stockier, than a horse, a mix somewhat of a hyena and plains bear. “They had come to destroy. To tear life from all flesh, to mock all claims of mastery… this was a new world for them. New, yet once it had been old. Changes had come. A world of vast silences where once kin and foe alike had opened throats in fierce challenge. Nothing was as it had been, and the Deragoth were made uneasy. They had come to destroy. But now hesitated. With eyes fixed on the one who had arrived, who now stood before them. Karsa steps forward and tells them that though the Chained God has reconsidered his “ambition…dream of mastery,” Karsa would face them. The Hounds separate and Karsa says, “You would let me pass?…Do you remember the Toblakai, beasts? But they had been gentled. By civilization. By the soft trappings of foolish peace. So weakened they could not stand before T’lan Imass, could not stand before Forkrul Assail and Jaghut. And now they cannot stand before Nathii slavers. An awakening was needed.” He moves between them and they attack as he expected them to. He badly wounds one and the other wraps his jaws around his leg. Karsa lifts it up and throws it down, then wraps his hands around its throat even as it rips at his arms. He kills it, then heads off after the one he had wounded.</p><p>SCENE TWENTY</p><p>Kalam and Quick step out from hiding and stare after Karsa leaving. They look at the Hound’s corpse, then Kalam suggests they drop of Dom and get out of there. Quick says it’s a brilliant plan. They leave, ignoring the “shadows pouring out of the burgeoning shattered warren of Kurald Emurlahn.”</p><p>SCENE TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Greyfrog meets Heboric and tells him he was sent by L’oric. He leads Heboric to him. L’oric has a Deck out and informs Heboric a Master has sanctioned the House of Chains. Heboric is surprised at first, then says “Let the gods rail, he or she had to do just that.” L’oric agrees, saying “The Crippled God is now as bound as is every other god.” Heboric wonders if he’ll regret this at some point. L’oric continues, saying the Crippled God is planning on taking the fragment of Kurald Emurlahn, though that has been made more difficult by Karsa’s killing of Bidithal, adding Karsa is the Knight in the House of Chains.” Heboric, not pleased about Karsa’s return, says his role is “unfortunate for the Crippled God. Toblakai will kneel to no one. He cannot afford to. He will defy all prediction.” L’oric interrupts to tell him Karsa has already done so, “to the possible ruination of us all. Still, at the same time, I have come to suspect he is our only hope…Two Hounds of Darkness arrived…and now I believe but one Deragoth remains [and]. .. . Toblakai even now pursues it.” Heboric asks what or who brought them there and who has Karsa just thwarted, but L’oric says he does not know and perhaps has yet to be decided. He asks Heboric to take Felisin away, saying Greyfrog will go with them though he himself will go to Sha’ik, “That mortal child is soon to be no more. The goddess is about to devour her soul even as we speak—and once that is done there shall be no return. The young Malazan girl you once knew will have ceased to exist. Thus, when I go to Sha’ik, I go not to that child, but to the goddess…I must speak to the goddess before she takes Sha’ik’s soul.” Heboric doesn’t answer, trying to figure out what L’oric wants from an insane goddess. L’oric tells him “There are two Felisins…Save the one you can.” When Heboric says someday he’ll find out who L’oric really is, L’oric responds: “I am a son who lives without hope of ever matching my father’s stride. That alone, in time, will explain all you need know of me.”</p><p>SCENE TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Karsa catches up to the Hound and they face off. Suddenly, Corabb’s horse bursts out and collides with the hound, throwing Corabb and Leoman to the ground and stunning the Hound. Karsa wounds it, then Leoman joins him in killing it. Karsa says he didn’t need Leoman’s help, but Leoman says he needs Karsa’s.</p><p>SCENE TWENTY-THREE</p><p>Pearl heads out of the oasis as “Kurald Emurlahn was opening like death’s own flower, with the oasis at its dark heart. He reaches where he’d left Lostara and is struck down by surprise by Kalam, who says, “That was for Malaz City. Even so, you owe me one.” Pearl says Kalam owes him for Henaras. Kalam replies she wasn’t worth counting, then drops Dom next to Pearl. Pearl agrees he owes Kalam, then listens as two sets of footsteps head off. He thinks, “The wizard was in no mood to talk, I suppose. To me, that is. I believe I ma sorely humbled.” He smiles and dawn arrives.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Six</strong></p><p>SCENE ONE</p><p>Sha’ik considers the Whirlwind Goddess and her own past. Since she first had let the goddess in, she has at times “caught a glimpse of that girl. As she once had been . . . Round-cheeked and flushed, a wide smile and bright eyes. A child with a brother who adored her, who would toss her about on one knee as if he was a bucking horse, and her squeals of fear and delight would fill the chamber.” Her mother had the gift of visions and younger Felisin had hoped she would share that gift, and now she has them from the goddess: “this spiteful, horrific creature whose soul was more parched and withered than any desert . . . [the visions] were the conjurings of fear. A goddess’s fear.” While she recognizes the goddess’s power, Sha’ik labels it “bitter with age, bilious with malice . . . [bearing] the sour taste of betrayal. A heart-piercing, very personal betrayal. Something that should have healed, that should have numbed . . . Spiteful pleasure had kept the wound open, had fed its festering heat, until hate was all that was left. Hate for someone.” Looking at it reasonably, Sha’ik can see this hate is insane, is out of all proportion to the crime against the goddess—”the proportions had begun wrong”—which makes her think the goddess pre-ascendancy was already deeply and darkly flawed, already perhaps insane or on the road toward insanity: “Step by step we walk the most horrendous paths. Stride tottering along the edge of an unsuspected abyss. Companions see nothing amiss. The world seems a normal place. Step by step, no different from everyone else—not from the outside. Not even from the inside. Apart from that tautness, that whisper of panic. The vague confusion that threatens your balance.” Felisin/Sha’ik sees this because “she had walked that same path. Hatred, sweet as nectar. I have walked into the abyss. I am as mad as the goddess. And this is why she chose me, for we are kindred souls . . . Why do I persist in my belief that I can save myself? That I can return, find once more the place where madness cannot be found, where confusion does not exist. The place of childhood.” Armored in her tent, she can feel the goddess reaching to embrace her—”not a mother’s embrace, no, nothing like that at all. This one would suffocate her entirely, would drown out all light, every glimmer of self-awareness. Her ego is armored in hatred . . . Her walk is a shamble, cramped and stiff, a song of rusty fittings and creaking straps . . . Felisin Paran, hold this mirror up at your peril.” As dawn begins, she reaches for her helm.</p><p>SCENE TWO</p><p>L’oric is surprised at the lack of movement in the Dogslayer trenches. As he moves toward Sha’ik’s forward position, he wonders at his sense that last night somehow Darkness had been defeated. He feels too that this fragment of Kurald Emurlahn is waking and the goddess is readying herself to claim it, “to fashion a throne. To devour Raraku.” He notes the ghosts of soldiers still in the shadows and can hear them singing, the Tanno song changed now to one more “pensive, mournful.” He wonders why the ghost soldiers are there, whom they will fight for. He knows the Tanno song belongs to the Bridgeburners, but senses “the Holy Desert itself had claimed it . . . And every soul that had fallen in battle in the desert’s immense history was now gathered in this place.” As he nears Sha’ik’s hill, he sees Mathok’s soldiers but, worryingly, neither Mathok himself nor his personal tribe. Leoman and Karsa appear behind him, Karsa badly wounded, “his hands a crimson ruin. One leg had been chewed by vicious, oversized jaws.” Behind their horses they drag the heads of the two Deragoth Karsa killed. When he sees Karsa’s stone sword, L’oric thinks, “He is indeed the one, then. I think the Crippled God has made a terrible mistake.” Karsa tells them he killed Febryl and Bidithal, but couldn’t find Dom or Heboric to kill them as well. Though, he adds, he did find the corpses of Reloe and Henaras. Leoman and Karsa tell L’oric the Dogslayers have all been slaughtered by the ghosts of Raraku and Leoman says they can still win with the desert warriors; they just have to convince Sha’ik to leave so they can regroup. L’oric tells him the goddess is almost there and so it’s too late—”Moments from being too late for everything.” The step over the ridge and see Sha’ik. Leoman realizes “I’m not in time. Oh, gods below” and then he opens his warren, jumps toward Sha’ik, and disappears.</p><p>SCENE THREE</p><p>The goddess savors her memories, her anger and hate having carved them “as mockingly solid and real-seeming” as the petrified trees. “The hate was all that mattered now. Her fury at his [her betrayer’s] weaknesses. Oh, others in the tribe played those games often enough . . . she herself had more than once spread her legs to another woman’s husband . . . But her heart had been given to the one man with whom she lived. That law was sacrosanct. Oh, but he’d been so sensitive. His hands following his eyes in the fashioning of forbidden images of that other woman, there in the hidden places. He’d used those hands to close about his own heart, to give it to another—without a thought as to who had once held it for herself. Another, who would not even give her heart in return—she had seen to that, with . . . accusations. Enough to encourage the others to banish her forever. But not before the bitch killed all but one of her kin . . . Her rage had not died with the Ritual, had not died when she herself—too shattered to walk—had been severed from the Vow and left in a place of eternal darkness.” Local spirits had “drawn close in sympathy” and she’d fed on them, taken their powers. “She had a purpose. The children swarmed the surface of the world. And who was their mother? None other than the bitch who had been banished. And their father? Oh yes, she went to him. On that last night. She did. He reeked of her when they dragged him into the light . . . Vengeance was a beast long straining at its chains. Vengeance was all she had ever wanted. Vengeance was about to be unleashed . . . The children will die. I will cleanse the world of their beget, the proud-eyed vermin born, one and all, of that single mother. Of course she could not join the ritual. A new world waited within her. And now at last, I shall rise again. Clothed in the flesh of one such child, I shall kill that world.” She sees a tunnel opening and looks forward to feeling again, to breathing, to killing.</p><p>SCENE FOUR</p><p>Sha’ik moves down the hill. She hears shouts behind her and recognizes the voices of Karsa and Leoman. She knows they’d take her place, “But they cannot. This fight belongs to me. And the goddess.”</p><p>SCENE FIVE</p><p>Keneb enters Tavore’s tent as she armors herself and he tells her Gamet has died from a clot in his brain. She has to steady herself on the table, then begins to order him to get T’amber when a messenger rushes in to say Sha’ik has walked into the basin and offered a challenge to Tavore. She thinks for a moment, belays her order about T’amber, then dismisses them. Outside, the messenger asks Keneb if he thinks Tavore will fight Sha’ik. He says yes, but there will be a battle anyway. Keneb goes to T’amber’s tent and calls her. She steps out, armored and weaponed, and he tells her that Tavore has just been informed of Gamet’s death and of a personal challenge from Sha’ik. He says Tavore might want help with her armor. But T’amber replies, “Not this morning, Captain. I understand your motives. But no.” Keneb thinks, surprised, “I do not understand women,” then turns to see Tavore exit her tent, fully armored and wearing a helm with no visor to cover her eyes. He follows her.</p><p>SCENE SIX</p><p>L’oric forces himself through a blackwood forest filled with shadow wraiths; he is seeking the goddess. He sees fire and runs toward it, sees it is her, the flames confirming his suspicion: “An Imass, trailing the chains of Telann, the Ritual shattered—oh, she has no place her, no place at all. Chthonic spirits swarmed her burning body, the accretions of power she had gathered unto herself over hundreds of thousands of years. Hatred and spite had twisted them all into malign, vicious creatures. Marsh water and mold had blackened the limbs of the Imass. Moss covered the torso . . .Ropes of snarled gray hair hung down . . . From her scorched eye sockets, living flames licked out . . . The goddess was keening. As he nears, L’oric sees she is stuck in a web of vines, wrapped around her arms and legs and body: “they were flickering, one moment there, the other gone—although no less an impediment for their rhythmic disappearance—and they were <em>changing</em>. Into chains. L’oric yells to her that Sha’ik isn’t strong enough for the goddess but she answers “My child! Mine! I stole her from the bitch! Mine!” L’oric has no idea what she is talking about, but he offers himself in Sha’ik’s place. Before she can respond, he is stabbed from behind, a killing blow had he been human. The assassin is about to cut his throat when another says there’s no time, warning that the goddess is breaking the chains. L’oric drops to the ground and sees the assassins, with sorcery-invested knives, kill the goddess: “a prolonged, brutal butchering. Korbolo’s Talons . . . waiting in ambush, guided here by Febryl.” He watches the goddess kill three of the four assassins, but “more chains ensnared the goddess, dragging her down, and L’oric could see the fires dying in her eye sockets, could see spirits writhe away, suddenly freed and eager to flee. And the last killer darted in, hammering down with his knife. Through the top of the skull . . . both skull and blade shattered . . . Chains snaked over the fallen body of the goddess, nothing visible was left of her, the black iron links heaped and glistening.” The wind dies and all goes silent. L’oric thinks “They all wanted the shattered warren. This fraught prize. But Toblakai killed Febryl. He killed the two Deragoth. He killed Bidithal. And as for Korbolo Dom—something tells me the Empress will soon speak to him in person. The poor bastard.” He realizes he is dying, but then Osric appears and tells him this is what he gets for sending his familiar away again. He adds L’oric’s room hasn’t changed since L’oric left the keep (which Osric hasn’t seen in centuries). L’oric wonders if the keep is still standing and Osric says, “It still stands, son. I always keep my options open.” He gathers L’oric in his arms to bring him to his old room to heal him. L’oric is surprised, at his age, how much at peace he feels “in his father’s arms.” At least, until his father says “Now how in Hood’s name do we get out of here?</p><p>SCENE SEVEN</p><p>Sha’ik stumbles, feeling the goddess’ departure. She sees Tavore descending the hill toward her and around them, ringing the ridge and the islands of coral, the armies watching. She feels herself again: “She is gone. I have been abandoned. I was Sha’ik, once. No, I am Felisin once more. And here, walking towards me, is the one who betrayed me. My sister. She remembered watching Tavore and Ganoes playing with wooden swords . . . Had the world beyond not changed—had all stood still, the way children loved to believe it would—she would have had her turn. The clack of wood, Ganoes laughing and gently instructing her—there was joy and comfort to her brother . . . but she’d never had the chance for that. No chance, in fact, for much of anything that could now return to her, memories warm and trusting and reassuring. Instead, Tavore had dismembered their family. And for Felisin, the horrors of slavery and the mines. But blood is the chain that can never break [She sees Tavore draw her sword] And though we leave the house of our birth, it never leaves us [she is surprised to find her own sword drawn] No catching up. No falling back. How could there be? We are ever the same years apart. The chain never draws taut. Never slackens. Its length is prescribed. But its weight, oh, its weight ever varies. [she feels light, “perfect”]. But for me, the blood is heavy. So heavy. And Felisin struggled against it—that sudden overwhelming weight. Struggled to raise her arms—unthinking of how that motion would be received. Tavore, it’s all right.” Then her sword is knocked out of her hand and “something punched into her chest, a stunning blossom of cold fire piercing through flesh, bone . . . Felisin looked down to see that rust-hued bald impaling her.” She falls back and looks up to see Tavore standing over her, “a figure standing behind a web of black, twisted iron wire that now rested cool over her eyes, tickling her lashes. A figure who now stepped closer. To set one bot down hard on her chest—a weight that, now that it had arrived, seemed eternal.” Tavore pulls the sword free: “Blood. Of course. This is how you break the unbreakable chain. By dying. I just wanted to know Tavore, why you did it. And why you did not love me, when I loved you. I—I think that’s what I wanted to know. The boot lifted from her chest. But she could still feel its weight. Heavy. So very heavy. Oh, Mother, look at us now.”</p><p>SCENE EIGHT</p><p>Karsa catches Leoman as he nearly drops to the ground in response to seeing Sha’ik killed. He tells Karsa “she did not know how to fight,” and Karsa agrees. He wonders why the Malazan army isn’t cheering and Leoman guesses, “They probably hate the bitch.” Leoman plans on riding to Y’Ghatan but Karsa says he won’t join them. The two make their farewells.</p><p>SCENE NINE</p><p>Lostara and Pearl walk down the hill carrying Dom. Tavore stands over Felisin’s body, but is looking instead at the standard raised over the Dogslayer trenches—Coltaine’s standard, the Crow Clan. Lostara recalls their journey to the basin: “Kurald Emurlahn swarmed the entire oasis, as shadows warred with ghosts, and the incessant rise and fall of that song grew audible enough for Lostara to sense, if not hear. A song still climbing in crescendo.” Lostara though can only think of how she and Pearl had come too late, had come only in time to see Tavore kill her own sister: “I didn’t ask for this. I don’t want it. I’ll never be without it. Oh, queen, forgive me.” Tavore looks up at her and Lostara thinks there will be time later for private conversation. Pearl drops Dom down to the ground. Tavore asks what the two of them are doing there, if they lost the trail. Pearl tells her “We found her, Adjunct. With deep regret, Felisin is dead.” When Tavore asks if they’re certain, he answers “Yes . . . I can say one thing for certain Tavore. She died quickly.” Tavore is quiet for a long moment, and then says “Well, there is mercy in that, I suppose,” then walks to meet her officers. Pearl picks up Felisin, saying, “She’s a heavier burden than you might think.” To which Lostara says “No, Pearl. I don’t think that.” She asks where he’ll take her and replies, “A hilltop, you know the one.” After he says he’ll try to convince them to get out of Raraku as soon as possible. She tells him to come for her when he’s done or she’ll come with him. He says he will. He watches Tavore and says “Just watching her walking away. She looks so . . . ” Lostara asks “alone” and he says, “Yes. That is the word, isn’t it.” He leaves by warren.”</p><p>SCENE TEN</p><p>Keneb watches Tavore come toward them: “There was none of the triumph there he thought he would see. Indeed, she looked worn down, as if the failing of spirit that followed every battle had already come to her, the deathly stillness of the mind that invited dire contemplation, that lifted up the host of questions that could never be answered. She orders Blistig to send scout to the Dogslayer trenches and informs them the Claw has delivered Dom. Nil tells her the Dogslayers are all dead via Raraku’s ghosts as well as, according to Nether “the spirits of our own slain. Nil and I—we were blind to it. We’d forgotten the ways of seeing. The cattle dog, Adjunct. Bent. It should have died at Coltaine’s feet. At the Fall. But some soldiers save it, saw to the healing of its wounds.” Tavore asks what she’s talking about and Nil and Nether continue: “Bent and Roach. The only creatures still living to have walked the Chain the entire way. Two dogs [Temul adds Duiker’s mar] . . . They came back with us . . . And the spirits of the slain. Our own ghosts, Adjunct, have marched with us . . . Step by step, Adjunct, our army of vengeance grew . . . Last night, the child Grub woke us . . . so we could witness the awakening. There were <em>legions</em>, Adjunct, that had marched this land a hundred thousand years ago. And Pormqual’s crucified army . . . Thus you were right Adjunct. In the dreams that haunted you from the very first night of this march, you saw what we could not see. It was never the burden you believed it to be. You did not <em>drag</em> the Chain of Dogs with you.” Tavore asks, “Did I not?” then wonders “All those ghosts simply to slay the Dogslayers?” But Nether says there were other enemies. The two also tell her Gamet rode with the ghosts and that Grub spoke to him. Baralta interrupts to tell Tavore Lostara stole Sha’ik’s body. Tavore ignores him and asks who the two soldiers Baralta arrived with are. They introduce themselves as Captain Kindly and Lieutenant Pores and say they were prisoners in the Dogslayer camp, freed by Bridgeburner ghosts. She dismisses them to get cleaned up. She tells Keneb (back to Fist) to prepare to follow Leoman’s group of desert warriors: “If we have to cross this entire continent, I will see them cornered and then I will destroy them. This rebellion will be ashes on the wind when we are done.” A warning is shouted and they all look to see Karsa riding down the hill toward them. Squint, one of Tavore’s bodyguards, identifies Karsa as a Thelomen Toblakai riding a Jhag horse. Lostara asks what’s dragging behind the horse and then they all flinch as they see the Deragoth heads. They ready their swords, but Tavore tells them to hold as he’s made no threat. Karsa tells Tavore, “Once long ago I claimed the Malazans as my enemies. I was young. I took pleasure in voicing vows. The more enemies the better. So it was, once. But no longer. Malazan, you are no longer my enemy. Thus I will not kill you. Tavore says “drily” that they’re all relieved. Karsa is quiet a moment then simply says, “You should be,” and rides off. Squint says, “Something tells me the bastard was right.” Tavore responds, “An observation I’ll not argue, soldier.”</p><p>SCENE ELEVEN</p><p>Lieutenant Ranal fights his horse and someone behind Fiddler says, “Gods take me, somebody shoot him.” Cuttle asks what Ranal is up to, pointing out they’ve left Gesler and the other squads behind. They join Ranal atop the raised road and he points out a group of 20 or so desert warriors. Fiddler tells Ranal: “There’s a spider lives in these sands. Moves along under the surface, but drags a strange snakelike tail that every hungry predator can’t help but see . . . Hawk comes down to snatch up that snake and ends up dissolving in a stream down that spider’s throat.” Ranal ignores him and says the warriors are there because they got out late, probably looting he says. Fiddler warns him they’d be better to wait for the rest of the company; they’ll catch them anyway. Ranal orders them ahead after the warriors. Fiddler sees something strange on the horizon as Ranal yells the warriors have left the road. They’re heading for a sandstorm and Fiddler tries to tell Ranal not to go in, but Ranal orders pursuit anyway.</p><p>SCENE TWELVE</p><p>Gesler sees the Tiste Liosan heading toward him and his group fast and he wonders who they are. Stormy points out whoever they are they don’t seem pleased with Gesler and the group. Gesler calls up Sands (a sapper) and asks if he’s tried his new munitions crossbow. Sans says no and Gesler orders the others to retreat to the other side of the dune. Sands lobs a cusser and there’s a large explosion. After recovering, Gesler looks down and says “Well, they wont be chasing us any more I’d say . . . Armor seems to have weathered the blast—you could go down and scrape out whatever’s left inside ’em.” He orders them to move out.</p><p>SCENE THIRTEEN</p><p>Jorrude groans. Enias tells him he wants to go home. Jorrude tells him to check the others. When Enias asks if Gesler’s group were really the trespassers they’d been seeking, the ones who road the ship through their realm, Jorrude says yes, “And I have been thinking. I suspect they were ignorant of Liosan laws when they traveled through our realm. True, ignorance is an insufficient defense. But one must consider the notion of innocent momentum. . Were not these trespassers but pulled along—beyond their will—in the wake of the draconian T’lan Imass bonecaster. If an enemy we must hunt, should it not be that dragon? Malachar calls that wise thinking and Jorrude says they’ll go home and resupply. They agree and Jorrude thinks, “It’s all the dragon’s fault, in fact. Who could refute that?”</p><p>SCENE FOURTEEN</p><p>Fiddler’s squad rides into the sandstorm and are immediately blinded. The desert warriors attack and Fiddler’s horse bucks him off, his bag of munitions rolling up over his head. He prepares to be blown up but then sees a warrior (Corabb) riding by clutching the bag in his arms in surprise. Fiddler runs then someone tells him “Not that way, you fool,” and Fiddler is shoved to the ground and covered by a body.</p><p>SCENE FIFTEEN</p><p>The bag nearly knocks Corabb off his horse. Near the ground he lets it go and is carried away by his horse as he pulls himself back up on it.</p><p>SCENE SIXTEEN</p><p>There’s a huge explosion, one Fiddler thinks should have killed him. The voice, which he recognized, tells him: “Can’t leave you on your own for a Hood-damned minute, can I? Say hello to Kalam for me, will ya? I’ll see you again, sooner or later. And you’ll see me too. You’ll see us all. Just not today. Damned shame ’bout your fiddle though.” The body disappears and Fiddler, on his knees, cries out “Hedge! Damn you, Hedge!” Cuttle finds him and tells him Ranal died in the explosion. The rest of the squad joins them, then Borduke’s group is seen. Smiles wonders at the size of the crater and says “Gods, Sergeant, you couldn’t have been much closer to Hood’s Gate and lived, could you?” He answers “You’ve no idea how right you are, lass.” As he listens to the song and feels his heart “matching that cadence,” he thinks “Raraku has swallowed more tears than can be imagined. Now comes the time for the Holy Desert to weep. Ebb and flow, his blood’s song, and it lived on. It lives on.”</p><p>SCENE SEVENTEEN</p><p>Fayelle, the last one of Dom’s mages left alive, realizes she and the thirteen Dogslayers had fled the wrong way. She thinks the ambush of Leoman had been perfect until the ghosts arrived. They themselves are ambushed and Fayelle is pinned under her dead horse. She looks up to see “The child. Sinn. My old student.” She tells Sinn she’ll wait for her at Hood’s gate, “and the wait won’t be long” and then Sinn kills her. Sinn rejoins the 16 surviving members of the Ashok regiment. She looks north and sees the horizon “limned in white, and it was <em>rising</em>.” Sinn thinks Fayelle knew what was coming, then they all get on the horses and ride as they hear “a roar that belittled even the Whirlwind Wall in its fullest rage. Raraku had risen. To claim a shattered warren.”</p><p>SCENE EIGHTEEN</p><p>Nil and Nether, sensing what was coming, had warned Tavore and the army got to the islands of coral—the highest points. They see high clouds, then hear “A roar unceasing, building, of water, cascading, foaming, tumbling across the vast desert. The Holy Desert, it seemed, held far more than bones and memories. More than ghosts and dead cities.” Lostara wonders if Pearl is high on that hill with Sha’ik’s grave and if it were high enough. And thinks too of what she’s seen recently: “Crucified dragons. Murdered gods. Warrens of fire and warrens of ashes. It was odd, she reflected, to be thinking these things even as a raging sea was born from seeming nothing and was sweeping towards them, drowning all in its path.” She’s upset as how hard she’d been on Pearl, “what a stupid thing to have let it happen.” Pearl appears and they banter like they had. He tells her they’ll survive the sea—where they stand were islands once. She asks what they’ll do stranded in the flooded basin on islands and he says he assumes they’ll build rafts and then a bridge; “I have every confidence in the Adjunct.” The sea hits and Lostara sees he’s right. She looks at Tavore and thinks, “Why does looking at you break my heart?”</p><p>SCENE NINETEEN</p><p>Fiddler’s squad, waiting for the sea to hit, watches Karsa riding away in the distance. Fiddler thinks the song of the sea is “strangely warm, almost comforting.” Then two men step out of a warren and he goes to embrace them: “they were his brothers. Mortal souls of Raraku. Raraku, the land that had bound them together. Bound them all, as was now clear, beyond even death.”</p><p>SCENE TWENTY</p><p>Heboric’s group looks down from the ridge to the sea below. They’re interrupted by Pust’s arrival on his mule. He tells them L’oric is not dead and they will be his guests.</p><p>SCENE TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Cutter in the top chamber of Pust’s temple. When he had woken, Apsalar had been gone and he knew she was gone and he could not follow. Cotillion joins him and tells him “There are countless paths awaiting you.” When Cutter says he knows Cotillion had spoken to Apsalar and helped her make a decision, Cotillion says the choice was hers to make. Cutter replies it doesn’t matter and admits that though Cotillion says there are countless paths, Cutter sees none “worth walking.” Cotillion asks if he wants one and tells him how once a man charged with protecting the life of a young girl had done so with such honor as “to draw, upon his sad death, the attention of Hood himself. Oh, the Lord of Death will look into a mortal’s soul, given the right circumstances, the uh, the proper incentive. Thus, that man is now Knight of Death.” When Cutter says he doesn’t want to be Knight or anything for anyone, Cotillion tells him that isn’t what he’s suggesting. He continues with the story of Baudin, saying he failed and the girl, Felisin, Captain Paran’s sister, is dead. Soon, he says, Pust will return with guests, including a child named Felisin, taken in by Paran’s sister: “She adopted a waif. A sorely abused foundling. She sought, I think—we will never know for certain, of course—to achieve something, something she herself had no chance, no opportunity, to achieve. Thus, she named the waif after herself.” When Cutter asks why he should care, what the girl is to him, Cotillion calls him obstinate and says the right question is “What are you to her?” He names her companions: another woman, a very remarkable one, as you—and she—will come to see. And with a priest, sworn now to Treach. From him, you will learn much of worth. Finally, a demon travels with these three humans. For the time being.” He explains they are stopping by to pick up Cutter: “Symmetry, lad is a power unto itself. It is the expression, if you will, of nature’s striving for balance. I charge you with protecting Felisin’s life. To accompany them on their long and dangerous journey.” Cutter replies, “How epic of you,” and Cotillion “snaps” angrily “I think not,” causing Cutter to regret his words. Cutter agrees to join them, but says, “abused, you said. Those ones are hard to get to. To befriend I mean. Their scars stay fresh and fierce with pain.” Cotillion says Felisin elder did OK despite her own scars and Cutter should count his blessings he has the daughter and not the mother, and to also think of Baudin must have felt. When Cutter begins to ask Cotillion more about “this notion of balance,” he is silenced by Cotillion’s eyes—”their unveiling of sorrow, of remorse” when he interrupts to say “From her to you. Aye.” Cutter wonders if Apsalar saw that and Cotillion says, “All too clearly, I’m afraid.” Cutter looks away, saying, “I loved her, you know. I still do,” to which Cotillion replies, “So you do not wonder why she has left.” And Cutter begins to cry as he answers, “No Cotillion, I do not.”</p><p>SCENE TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Karsa stops alongside the new inland sea for lunch, then pulls out Siballe’s head. He asks her what she sees and looking upon the water she says “My past . . . All that I have lost.” Karsa tells her “You once said that if you were thrown into the sea, your soul would be freed. That oblivion would come to you.” He asks if this was the truth and when she says yes, he picks her up and walks to the water’s edge. She says she doesn’t understand and he answers, “When I began this journey I was young. I believe in one thing. I believed in glory. I know now, ‘Siballe, that glory is nothing. Nothing. This is what I now understand . . . [and] one other thing. The same can not be said for mercy.” He throws her into the water and watches her head sink. Looking at his sword, he says, “Yes. I am Karsa Orlong of the Uryd, a Teblor. Witness my brothers. One day I will be worthy to lead such as you. Witness.” He rides “West, into the wastes.”</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Onrack meets with Minala and her “young killers.” She wonders if they can be trusted and Trull says he doesn’t know how to convince her except by giving her the whole of his “lengthy and rather unpleasant story. She says, “spare me” and exits the room. Trull begins to say he isn’t surprised that no one wants to hear it, but Onrack interrupts and says he will listen. Trull laughs at his audience: “a score of children who do not understand my native tongue, and three expressionless and indifferent undead. By tale’s end, only I will be weeping, likely for all the wrong reasons.” Monok looks at Onrack and says, “You have felt it . . . so you seek distraction.” When Trull inquires, Monok answers, “She is destroyed. The woman who gave Onrack her heart in the time before the Ritual. The woman to whom he avowed his own heart, only to steal it back. In many ways, she was destroyed then, already begun on her long journey to oblivion.” He stops to ask Onrack if denies it and when Onrack says no, Monok continues. “Madness, of such ferocity as to defeat the Vow itself. Like a camp dog that awakens one day with fever in its brain. That snarls and kills in a frenzy. Of course we had no choice but to track her down, corner her. And so shatter her, imprison her within eternal darkness . . . Madness, then, to defy even us. But now, oblivion has claimed her soul. A violent, painful demise, but none the less.” He stops in surprise, then says “Trull Sengar, you—have not begun your tale, yet already you weep.” Trull is silent a moment, then replies, “I weep, Monok Ochem, because he cannot.” Monok turns to Onrack and tells him, “Broken One, there are many things you deserve, but this man is not one of them.” When he turns away, Onrack speaks, “Monok Ochem, you have traveled far from the mortal you once were, so far as to forget a host of truths, both pleasant and unpleasant. The heart is neither given nor stolen. The heart <em>surrenders</em>.” Monok doesn’t bother to turn around when he replies, “That is a word without power to the T’lan Imass, Onrack the Broken.” But Onrack rejects that statement, saying “You are wrong, Monok Ochem. We simply changed the word to make it not only more palatable, but also to empower it. With such eminence that it devoured our souls.” When Monok denies that, Trull sighs, “Onrack’s right . . . You called it the Ritual of Telann . . . And you’ve the nerve to call Onrack <em>broken</em>.” A long silence follows, through which Onrack keeps his eye on Trull, patiently, thinking “To grieve is a gift best shared. As a song is shared. Deep in the caves, the drums beat. Glorious echo to the herds whose thundering hoofs celebrate what it is to be alive, to run as one, to roll in life’s rhythm. This is how, in the cadence of our voice, we serve nature’s greatest need. Facing nature, we are the balance. Ever the balance to chaos. Eventually his patience was rewarded. As he knew it would be.”</p><p> </p>
